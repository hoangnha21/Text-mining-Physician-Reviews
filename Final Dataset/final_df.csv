5,Dr. Allen David Bloom,Illinois,physician and surgeon license reprimanded and shall remain inactive due to an adverse action taken by the State of California in March 2021., Male,1.84,"Doctor left me deformed from a surgical procedure and now I have to pay another doctor to fix it This doctor SUCKS; stay away from him. Switched from in-network to out of network during my treatment and no one told me. Now I have these huge bills to pay. Performed surgery on me that is going to require plastic surgery to fix.... Please seek out another general surgeon AWFUL, do not use this man! He doesn't listen to you or your problems, he rushes your office visits, he's flighty in behavior and conversation, he suggests additional surgery even before he knows what the problem may be, he takes awful notes on the surgery he performs, and he doesn't give helpful post-surgical info. My neighbor's friend had very similar issues with this doctor for his surgery, and had I known about his experiences before I had my surgery, I would have changed doctors. I have an HMO not listed, and basically not a lot of choices in surgeons, but I had thyroid cancer and had to have my thyroid taken out. I am still recovering from a surgery that according to the webmd is pretty big procedure requiring special monitoring. My surgery took 35 minutes the first time, but later the same day I went back in surgery for uncontrolled bleeding and swelling. I still am waiting to see if my voice will return, another complication of surgery that I may have temporarily lost my voice, although it has been almost 6 months. My advice always go for a 2nd opinion, even with bad insurnace you are entitled to a second opinion and make sure it is not a doc from the same practice. The absolute WORST doctor. Please, do NOT use him. My father recently saw him for a tumor, and he immediately threw out the word 'cancer' even before a biopsy has been done. He then proceeded to tell us that my father needed a chemo port put in ASAP...again WIHOUT a confirmed diagnosis! Oh, and it's not cancerous. He was so insensitive, told my mother basically to stop crying. Terrible, terrible, terrible! This man should have his license revoked. This doctor completed an emergency appendectomy on my 11/6/2000. As I lay in the ER, He happened to walk past and was called to my room. He examined me and had more test done to diagnose my problem correctly. While in surgery, he discovered another problem but choose to not do the surgery on this unknown problem but did tell me about it upon my recovery. When I visited him in his office after surgery, he again asked if I had followed up on the problem that he discovered while on the table and proceeded to call my own doctor on the spot to ensure that I/the problem was taken care of. I found him to be very caring. However, that was 7 years ago! I beg you to NOT visit this physician. I felt like I was treated TERRIBLY by this doctor. I was left with numerous problems from the surgery this doctor performed on me. Also, he did not tell me all of the associated risks of the surgery that he performed on me. He also did not give me adequate pre-operative instructions for my surgery so I was left completely impacted after surgery. Ridding myself of the impaction caused additional PERMANENT damage to my own body. He is an UNCARING physician. He does not know how to offer any other medical advice other than to CUT. DO NOT visit this physician. In my opinion, he is the definition of BAD doctor.",The doctor just took out my thyroid. I guess he did a good job and various medical staff say he's a good surgeon. He rushes all the time. He didn't tell me any of the pro's or con's of surgery. He didn't tell me side effects of the medicine or what I may feel like after surgery. He was an hour late for the surgery. The nurses had a hard time getting in touch with him to discuss my very low calcium symptoms with him and get me medicine. I had a very hard time getting in touch with him when my symptoms become much worse at home. He never came to see me in the hospital after surgery. And I got a bill from his associate for 'helping' in the surgery. I never met him and not one person in the hospital mentioned he had a helper. No other doctor was waiting for him when he was running so late. My opinion - look into other surgeons. Dr. Bloom is a terrible physician/surgeon. He did not give me quality care. He seemed only interested in getting me in to surgery without giving me the proper pros and cons of the surgery. His bottom line is more important to him than truly listening and caring about his patients. Do NOT visit this doctor.

9,Dr. Andrew V. Pasternak,Michigan,Continuing Education, Male,3.63,"Dr. Pasternak was patient with me when discussing my issues during my first visit and he gave me a couple of doctor referrals upon request. I recently request a ENT referral for checking a lump under my chin. The referral was required by the ENT clinic I called to. After contacting Dr. Pasternak by emails along with follow-up phone calls for a week, however, his staffers still failed to track when my request will be responded to! I have never felt more demeaned in my life by this physician. I am a very compliant patient. Prior to seeing Dr. Pasternak I was told that I need to have my medical records sent over to him so that he could review them prior to my appointment. 

I also filled out their new patient paperwork and gave an extensive history of my health as supplemental information. He did not do so. Instead he spent a good half hour reviewing my medical records. Had he done what his office said that he supposedly does in reviewing these records prior to the appointment, his office could’ve called me and requested additional information that he did not have for this initial consultation.

I am a palled and disgusted that he would compare me to people who have overdosed on narcotic medicine like Prince. Now I understand that he does not know me at all but I offered for him to contact my last primary doctor and even take drug tests to prove that I do not take narcotic medicine as often as I should for my severe pain.

He would not listen to me as a patient as he was too busy searching through my records. I think he made eye contact with me once. I explained to him in detail the reason why I no longer see pain management doctors and that all other medicine has failed me.

I am not upset at the cautionary measure that he was taking in this initial consultation, but his demeaning, and I mean demeaning, and I mean the meaning attitude and implications left me no alternative but to fire him.

Dr. Pasternak I left your office feeling hopeless and worthless. You are a disgrace to the medical field. You need to learn to have a better bedside manner and listen to your patients. Either that or retire. Thank God I am not like prince who had a drug problem and thank God not all doctors I like you. My experience was disappointing and concerning. Dr. Pasternak was disengaged, nonchalant, unconcerned, and seemed overal uninterested in my medical issue of repetitive kidney stone, flank pain, and blood in urine. He was uncaring, apathetic, and dismissive. His demeanor with other patients as I could hear through my open exam room door was pleasant and engaged. I felt singled out and cheated of proper medical care. I received a referral to a urologist specialist. He didn't explain much of anything having to do with health problem and jumped right to a procedure of lithotripsy instead of offering dietary solutions. The fact that he sent me out the door with blood in my urine, no treatment and no instructions until I hear from the urologist was upsetting, especially since I'm still in severe pain and experienced a dangerous kidney infection just a few months prior to this visit. I was hoping for so much more. I've been a patient of his for over ten years and will be finding a new pcp asap. Staff are friendly, but incompetent. They have messed up my simple prescription every time I’ve gone there. I have also heard Dr. Pasternak and his staff openly complain about other patients as they sit in the waiting area. Dr. Pasternak lacks the people skills to be a physician and instead, probably should have been an accountant. He spends more time hiding behind his little computer than he does engaging the patient. Too bad he spent more time decorating his office w/his trophies than reading “Bedside Manners for Idiots”. Definitely find another physician.

If he'd put down his ipad for one second and pay attention, he might actually understand his pt. issues. What happened to the old fashioned, listen now, chart later? And one more thing, the ""I love me wall, look at me, validate how great I am shrine is overwhelming."" Yes Dr. we all can see how in shape you are and how many triathilons you've done. Good for you. Overall, was hoping for more and found nothing but frustration and disappoinment. I've been a patient of Dr. P's since 2009, after a surgery performed by another longtime doctor left me in a very bad state. Dr. P has been wonderful in treating me with all of my new ailments, as a new patient, and has always put a significant amount of thought into diagnostics and treatment and testing when I've seen him. I did find the constant staring at his tablet a bit offputting at first, but he's incredibly competent and that more than makes up for not knowing his eye color. He's been fantastic about refilling prescriptions, usually the same day, and I have had little problem getting into see him with an important problem. He's given me referrals to other specialists and I can not complain about him at all. I kind of think he's like House in his ability to diagnose, without having the jerk factor of the TV character. He's a fantastic doctor. His staff has always been friendly, thorough and prompt. Highly Recommended! I'm more than happy with Dr. Pasternak, I have been a patient of his since he was at the Ralston Clinic. He has taken very good care of me, and possibly saved my life when he discovered my carotid arteries were almost closed. How he knew to have them checked I don't know but he detected something and I had to have surgery to clean them out. He may have to use his computer but that just gives him/us better medical records. I would and have recommended him to friends. I consider him to be an excellent doctor and the longer he practices medicine, the more proficient he has become. Dr. Pasternak is my primary care physician and he recently treated me for a large subcutaneous infection. I appreciate the fact that he offered to treat it in his office after initial antibiotics were insufficient instead of referring me to a hospital for care. A less confident and risk adverse doctor would have sent me off to the hospital where they would treat me but at an exorbitant cost as an admitted patient. By performing a minor surgery in his office along with an antibiotic regimen I was able to enjoy an upcoming vacation vs cancelling it and spending my vacation money on hospital bills. THANK YOU Dr P. and I thank the office staff for dealing with my crappy insurance carrier. I understand the complaints made from patients in 2009 as I felt exactly the same way: too much tablet computer, not enough real listening or engagement. Otherwise, his advice seemed competent. With reluctance, I just saw him again after being unable to find anyone better, and I was HUGELY surprised. His staff seems much more on top of things and there are some new faces. His attentiveness has improved markedly and, although the tablet is still there, it doesn't dominate the appointment. I was very satisfied and impressed that Dr. Pasternak got the message and I now have no intention of changing doctors. Those previously disappointed should give him a second chance. Terrific with my teenage son! No one knows the field better or cares more deeply. I was a patient of Dr. Pasternak's when he was at Washoe Med and followed him to his private practice. Unfortunately, he has seemed to change his approach in interacting with patients. It is a truly a three-way conversation with the doctor and his PDA taking center stage. The best feature of a family practice doc is the ability to communicate with his patient and engender trust, thereby opening up the possibilities of optimum diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately Dr. Pasternak has lost that ability. I credit Dr.Pasternak with excellent care in the aftermath of a subarachnoid brain hemorrhage I experienced 5 years ago. After release from the hospital, the neurological surgery team cast me adrift with little advice or follow-up. I decided to visit Dr. P, our family physician, even though I wasn't sure much more could be done. Dr. P advised me to undergo speech/cognitive therapy and occupational therapy in an effort to restore my mental health to a degree that ZI could return to work as a research scientist. It wasn't clear if I could return to my job, but Dr.P wrote to my laboratory and told them of the seriousness of the hemorrhage and steps that were being taken to help me recover. It was a critical letter that gave me time to heal. After one and a half years of intense and continuous therapy, I was able to function in my job as a research scientist. Without Dr.P's intervention, I'm quite sure I would have had to retire. I'm working as well as ever. I owe much to Dr. P. This office was so wonderful and professional. The doctor was smart and he really cared about my health and well being. The staff was so friendly and nice. I felt taken care of. I was completely disappointed in the Dr./ patient rapore. Dr. Pasternak came across as disengaged, or rather preoccupied. If he'd put down his ipad for one second and pay attention, he might actually understand his pt. issues. What happened to the old fashioned, listen now, chart later? And one more thing, the ""I love me wall, look at me, validate how great I am shrine is overwhelming."" Yes Dr. we all can see how in shape you are and how many triathilons you've done. Good for you. Overall, was hoping for more and found nothing but frustration and disappoinment. I've been a patient of Dr. P's since 2009, after a surgery performed by another longtime doctor left me in a very bad state. Dr. P has been wonderful in treating me with all of my new ailments, as a new patient, and has always put a significant amount of thought into diagnostics and treatment and testing when I've seen him. I did find the constant staring at his tablet a bit offputting at first, but he's incredibly competent and that more than makes up for not knowing his eye color. He's been fantastic about refilling prescriptions, usually the same day, and I have had little problem getting into see him with an important problem. He's given me referrals to other specialists and I can not complain about him at all. I kind of think he's like House in his ability to diagnose, without having the jerk factor of the TV character. He's a fantastic doctor. His staff has always been friendly, thorough and prompt. Highly Recommended! I'm more than happy with Dr. Pasternak, I have been a patient of his since he was at the Ralston Clinic. He has taken very good care of me, and possibly saved my life when he discovered my carotid arteries were almost closed. How he knew to have them checked I don't know but he detected something and I had to have surgery to clean them out. He may have to use his computer but that just gives him/us better medical records. I would and have recommended him to friends. I consider him to be an excellent doctor and the longer he practices medicine, the more proficient he has become. Dr. Pasternak is my primary care physician and he recently treated me for a large subcutaneous infection. I appreciate the fact that he offered to treat it in his office after initial antibiotics were insufficient instead of referring me to a hospital for care. A less confident and risk adverse doctor would have sent me off to the hospital where they would treat me but at an exorbitant cost as an admitted patient. By performing a minor surgery in his office along with an antibiotic regimen I was able to enjoy an upcoming vacation vs cancelling it and spending my vacation money on hospital bills. THANK YOU Dr P. and I thank the office staff for dealing with my crappy insurance carrier.

10,Dr. Anthony Molinari,Illinois,physician and surgeon license reprimanded for issues related to prescribing controlled substances to several patients of his practice., Male,4.48,,"My parents were patients of Dr. Molinari for many years. Mother use to bake cookies for him. He called on her at home during her final days. They were very pleased with him. He always took his time. He cared. Highly recommend.. Very knowledgeable & wonderful communication skills... Wonderful doctor!!! I have a few problems with my joints and he literally sat with with me for an hour discussing the possibilities and helped me reach a solution, best doctor I've ever had! Plus he has wonderful ""bed side manner"". Dr. Molinari takes the time to listen to me, that means alot to me. Not one to push pills, but recommends the benefit of good nutrition, and exercise. He doesn't rush you, a big plus in my book! Dr. Molinari has taken great care of me and my husband for the last 15 years. He is very knowledgeable and caring. If you don't have a lot of money, he will help find low cost meds or give you samples. He has always listened to all my concerns and answered my questions completely. When I needed a specialist, he gave me a good recommendation. The only downside is that I generally waited 30 mins to an hour after my appointment time. He has a large client base in our community. It should be getting better since he added another doctor to his practice. Overall, a Great Doctor! The office seems more interested in your payment than the patient. The doctor does not call patients with their lab results when he receives them. You have to wait until your next visit. Prescription refils cost $90- you must make an appt to get the new script. Even on blood pressure medicine that you have been taking for years. It seems to be all about the money. The doctor is very knowledgeable, but rarely are you seen at your appt time. Usually at least 30 minutes late. His time is more important that yours. During my visit I felt that I was treated very well.I would absolutely recommend this doctor to my family and friends.I felt this visit was an amazing success!Overall I would rate this visit : outstanding!",,7.0,7,,parent patient   many year mother use bake cooky called home final day pleased always took time cared highly recommend knowledgeable wonderful communication skill wonderful doctor problem joint literally sat hour discussing possibility helped reach solution best doctor ive ever plus wonderful bed side manner   take time listen mean alot one push pill recommends benefit good nutrition exercise doesnt rush big plus book   taken great care husband last 15 year knowledgeable caring dont lot money help find low cost med give sample always listened concern answered question completely needed specialist gave good recommendation downside generally waited 30 min hour appointment time large client base community getting better since added another doctor practice overall great doctor office seems interested payment patient doctor call patient lab result receives wait next visit prescription refils cost 90 must make appt get new script even blood pressure medicine taking year seems money doctor knowledgeable rarely seen appt time usually least 30 minute late time important visit felt treated welli would absolutely recommend doctor family friendsi felt visit amazing successoverall would rate visit outstanding,1.55e-05,6.11e-06,1.47e-05,2.48e-05,0.000112159,0.000161535,1e-06,4.8e-05,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,1,1,1,0,0
11,Dr. Aram Bonni,Illinois,physician and surgeon license restored with reprimand due to an adverse action taken by the State of California in December 2015., Male,2.81,I just had surgery in March 2020. Wasn't given any discharge papers and the doctor won't respond to me neither will his staff. I was told that I was getting a quarter-size incision and it is two if not three times that size. I am having trouble with sensation of my intestines and bladder and he's just brushing off this issue. Don't go to this doctor Under investigation with medical state board. Then fired from previous hospitals that he has worked at. Dr Bonni will lie and do surgery on you that you don't even need. Money hungry insurance fraud. Dr Bonnie did surgery on me. Because of this I got very sick and almost died. I have had many surgery to repair his mistake.,"Dr.Bonni preformed a Tubal Ligation Reversal on me Jan 2016. I am very happy with his professionalism and patient care. I would highly reccomend Dr.Bonni. Dr Bonni did my tubal reversal in June of 2015. He is amazing. I was pregnant with twin boys within a month he is brilliant. I appreciate his hard work and time he spent with me answering my questions. Thank you Dr Bonni I had surgery with Dr Bonni a few years ago and it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I have not been able to have intercourse with my husband ever since. When I expressed my concerns to him he arrogantly blew me off and said ""no you're going to like this"". What a jerk! I should have known there was some problem when he suddenly and mysteriously left a previous office. After the surgery he apparently had no office and had me meet him at random offices, including a chiropractor, for rechecks. It felt very weird and unprofessional. All I can say is that if anyone is considering having surgery with him I would recommend running the other way. I am not normally a complainer, I am usually happy with with every dr and surgery I've had in my life, but I just hope I can save someone from going through what I have had to go through. He has caused great harm to my health and my marriage. Thank You, Dr. Bonni for making me not feel self-conscious.

19,Dr. Bhanoo Sharma,Illinois,physician and surgeon license temporarily suspended after he surrendered his Oregon medical license while under investigation by Oregon of his Illinois-based surgery practice which revealed that he was grossly negligent in his performance of liposuction and autologous fat transfer to patients of his practice, Male,4.33,WASTE OF $1600. I paid Dr. Sharma for botox and there was no change. I asked him to correct it and he requested more money. I decline that he suggested a surgery for more money. I decline that and ask for a refund since there was no changes he quickly left. Later on that day I called to say this wasn't right and his staff became rude and unprofessional. If you pay that kind of money for something you want to see some kind of results but nothing change at all.,"I just had my thighs and mid section liposuctioned. His team was great and they could not have done a better job. I also had a fat transfer done and I am rocking my bikini. Thank you Dr. Sharma. You and your staff are the best! I just had my breast augmentation with Dr. Bhanoo Sharma. I had gone to many consultations in Chicago with other surgeons where I felt like a number. Dr. Sharma put me at ease and I loved his staff. The anesthesiologist was also great. I woke up pain free and with breasts for the first time. I highly recommend Dr. Sharma and Shape Cosmetic Surgery for breast implants. Good luck ladies on your journey. Truly cares about his patients! Takes the time to answer questions or concerns! Staff was so helpful and reassuring was there thru my surgery and recovery!! It was the best experience I could have asked for! My husband and I went to see Dr.Sharma for a consultation and we can both undoubtedly say it was the best decision that we made.I had gained nearly 60 pounds over the last year do to stress and felt completely defeated, I didnt even know where to start on getting back to my real self!I decided to have nearly my entire body treated and I am SO glad I did! I have already lost over 30 pounds but everyone tells me I look like I have lost over 50 pounds! Dr. Sharma is AMAZING he is the most talented surgeon ever! He listened to what I wanted and he more than delivered! I am more motivated then I have even been, I work out 2 hours a day and eat better then I ever have. People ask me all the time if i am happy and I say happy in an understatement,I cannot even put into words words how Dr. Sharma and his staff changed my life. My husband is extremely happy with his results and I am so happy that we were able to both share this experience, this has brought us closer then ever! I cannot begin to express how impressed I am with the breast augmentation, liposuction, and the COCO butt that you have given me.I am so glad I chose you to do the work.Even though this is only my second day post surgery, I am already VERY pleased with the results. Thank you for giving me the self confidence and self esteem that I was lacking for so many years. Both you and your staff were supportive throughout the journey. It still amazes me the length you will go out of your way for your patients.My new breasts, and butt are beautiful and I am completely content with the results. Dr. Sharma thank you again for everything. I feel like a brand new woman because of you. I cannot thank you enough for your quality of care, professionalism, and concern that was demonstrated by all of the staff.Dr. Sharma I cannot say enough about your skill and talent. Amazing!

20,Dr. Blaise J. Wolfrum,Illinois,physician and surgeon license indefinitely suspended for a minimum of 60 days for continuing to direct and/or delegate care and treatment of the patients of his psychiatric practice while suspended., Male,2.78,"No longer licensed to practice medicine in Illinois. This guy was the worst medical experience I ever had he'd keep me waiting over an hour for my scheduled appointment without remorse I am a stroke survivor and when I finally got in to see him he didn't remember why I was there or thT I had had a stroke -------------------------------------------------------------- I've been his patient on and off for many years and he has helped get through every crisis with flying colors. STAY FAR FAR AWAY. ONLY WANTS YOUR MONEY. ARROGANT AND RUDE. YOU WILL BE WAITING MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR YOUR APPT. UNDER INVESTIGATION..ALSO SUSAN ORCO APN..TO TESTIFY........ SEE REVIEW FOR DES PLAINES OFFICE/NEED I SAY MORE!!!! Arrogant and dismissive. Spent 7 minutes with me (that includes the phone call he took) Bedside manner should be BADside manner. I have had one experience with BHCA in which I was attempting to deal with severe depression and thoughts of suicide. After mustering the courage to seek help and spilling my guts about inner fears and issues Dr. Blaise Wolfrum replied with disdain and condescension. His flippant comments and lack of concern is truly troubling for a person supposedly in the profession of helping people in need. His first comment ""why are you depressed when others have it worse than you"" was a stinging slap across the face and set the tone for the rest of the time with him. When I described my plans for suicide he ridiculed me. This man's attitude and and condemnation might motivate someone training for a race but has no place in the treatment of people who are in need of support and guidance. I would not recommend this organization to anyone looking for compassion or a caring attitude. This doctor was late for every appoitment that I had. I don't mean five minutes, say about one half hour. Then he sneak in the back door. His staff is horrible. They practically barked at me to pay upfront before I even saw the doctor. I paid $360 because I was desperate for someone to talk to. I ended up waiting over 1.5 hours past my appointment and all I got was a 20-25 minute session which wasn't very helpful. He prescribed me some medication and that was it. Then a month later I tried to get another prescription and he wanted $50 just to write me the prescription. I would not advise seeing this man. This doctor and his office ripped off my insurance company. Besides being completely unfriendly and rude and having an extremely long wait; this Doctor was completely cold and unfeeling. They charged me up front AND took my insurance information - when I cancelled my appointment with them (ahead of time) I noticed that they STILL charged my insurance even though I had pain in cash up front and not actually kept the apppointment. Stay away from this guy! This Dr. does not care about his patients at all!! All he does care about is MONEY. On a typical day patients wait 2hours past thier appt. time just to see him, and god forbid if you ask his staff, a bunch of RUDE Morans!!!!!!","I feel extremely lucky to have Dr Wolfram for a psychiatrist! I've been a patient of Dr. Wolfrum since the 90s and he has helped get through many-a-crisis as well as day to day stressful situations. Once in a while I have to wait more than 30 minutes, but it's well worth it. Dr.Wolfrum has been the most educated, kind, and most trustworthy to my case. I am very happy with Dr. Wolfrum and would recommend him in a heartbeat to anybody. What has me very upset right now is the extreme difficulty I had getting to the point where I could rate this doctor. RateMDs.com needs to make their site much more user friendly. I was seeing Dr. Wolfrum mainly for anger management. He has helped me a lot. If this had happened several years ago, I probably would have slammed my monitor against the wall and yelled obscenities toward RateMDs at the top of my lungs. Thank you Dr. Wolfrum for teaching me enough self control where that didn't happen. I've been seeing Dr. Wolfrum because I had poor social skills. I was very quiet and shy and totally lacked any self confidence when trying to interact with people. Thanks to the good doctor, I've come a long way. I'm now dating a beautiful and wonderful lady and have a great job which involves dealing with people on a social level. I can never thank Dr. Wolfrum enough for the way he has helped me turn my life around. I've been a patient of Dr. Wolfrum for many years. The good always outweighed the bad but things weren't always perfect. The office staff were sometimes rude and the wait was sometimes very long. However, that was the past. The current staff is friendly and accommodating and the wait times are now very reasonable. Dr. Wolfrum has always been an excellent psychiatrist so I give him my highest recommendation. I like Dr. Wolfrum so far. He's been helping me greatly with my confidence and self esteem. With continued visits I'm sure my life overall will become much better.",13.0,7.0,20,longer licensed practice medicine illinois guy worst medical experience ever hed keep waiting hour scheduled appointment without remorse stroke survivor finally got see didnt remember tht stroke ive patient many year helped get every crisis flying color stay far far away want money arrogant rude waiting hour appt investigationalso susan orco apnto testify see review de plaines officeneed say arrogant dismissive spent 7 minute includes phone call took bedside manner badside manner one experience bhca attempting deal severe depression thought suicide mustering courage seek help spilling gut inner fear issue    replied disdain condescension flippant comment lack concern truly troubling person supposedly profession helping people need first comment depressed others worse stinging slap across face set tone rest time described plan suicide ridiculed man attitude condemnation might motivate someone training race place treatment people need support guidance would recommend organization anyone looking compassion caring attitude doctor late every appoitment dont mean five minute say one half hour sneak back door staff horrible practically barked pay upfront even saw doctor paid 360 desperate someone talk ended waiting 15 hour past appointment got 2025 minute session wasnt helpful prescribed medication month later tried get another prescription wanted 50 write prescription would advise seeing man doctor office ripped insurance company besides completely unfriendly rude extremely long wait doctor completely cold unfeeling charged front took insurance information cancelled appointment ahead time noticed still charged insurance even though pain cash front actually kept apppointment stay away guy  care patient care money typical day patient wait 2hours past thier appt time see god forbid ask staff bunch rude morans,feel extremely lucky  wolfram psychiatrist ive patient   since 90 helped get manyacrisis well day day stressful situation wait 30 minute well worth  educated kind trustworthy case happy   would recommend heartbeat anybody upset right extreme difficulty getting point could rate doctor ratemdscom need make site much user friendly seeing   mainly anger management helped lot happened several year ago probably would slammed monitor wall yelled obscenity toward ratemds top lung thank   teaching enough self control didnt happen ive seeing   poor social skill quiet shy totally lacked self confidence trying interact people thanks good doctor ive come long way im dating beautiful wonderful lady great ob involves dealing people social level never thank   enough way helped turn life around ive patient   many year good always outweighed bad thing werent always perfect office staff sometimes rude wait sometimes long however past current staff friendly accommodating wait time reasonable   always excellent psychiatrist give highest recommendation like   far he helping greatly confidence self esteem continued visit im sure life overall become much better,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.993858155,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999,1,1,1,0,0

22,Dr. Brian P. Ragona,Illinois,physician and surgeon license reprimanded and fined $7500 for inappropriate controlled substance prescribing., Male,3.06,"Aloof, but doesn't miss a thing. He has excellent diagnostic intuition with a lab in the building for confirmation. He's hooked into the medical community and knows who to refer his patients when necessary. The front end staff is abrasive. They may forget the people coming there are ill and pay the bills. To be fair, I think most front end medical staff in Joliet are unprofessional. TO LONG OF WAIT TIME USUALLY AT LEAST 2HOURS, AND THEN HE CALLS IT OFF VERY POOR ATTENDANCE ON HIS PART AND ALWAYS LATE First off, I was delayed 2 hours waiting for the Doctor to return to the office from lunch. Then a Nurse Practicioner decided to diagnose me without the Doctor present. When the Doctor did finally arrive in my room, he listened to my heartbeat and said his Nurse Practictioner ""probably had the diagnosis right."" All that time and $240 for the Doctor to listen to my heartbeat!!! And yes, the diagnosis was wrong. Would not recommend Dr. Ragona to my enemy! During my visit I felt that I was treated poorly.I would NEVER recommend this doctor to my family and friends.I felt this visit was a complete waste of time and money.Overall I would rate this visit : AWFUL!","Unfortunately there is a word limit on these reviews, and the complaints about Dr. Ragona and the way he runs his practice are nearly limitless. First is a common complaint found on every single Dr.'s review site on the web. Your wait time for an appointment is nearly 2 hours on average, worse yet there has been many occasions, after you find yourself sitting for hours on end, a secretary or nurse will come over and inform you that he hasn't even showed up that day, and it's time to reschedule. Also be aware that if you find yourself on one of the nearly non existent occasions that he is there and running according to schedule; if YOU are even 10 minutes late, rescheduled!! Doesn't matter at all how many times you waited for him on previous visits, it's not about you, it's when he feels like working. And when he does work, expect every dangerous and unproven drug being forced upon you whether your comfortable with it or not. God forbid you have side effects, because then once again you'll find yourself subject to be ignored and rescheduled. At one point my wife was in a minor car accident and only needed a mild painkiller, instead she was prescribed an incredibly strong and dangerous opioid. She was literally in and out consciousnesses all CHRISTMAS EVE. We had to see another Dr. because as usual, he made himself unavailable. When the new Dr. seen what she was prescribed, he was very un-nerved and told her she was lucky she didn't overdose on one of the day's recommended dosages, let alone the other 3 prescribed. Furthermore he apparently paired that drug with another that are known to interact negatively together. I'm trying to stay within the word limit, so I guess the next useful advice is, according to him (or his ""dedicated"" work ethic), his facilities do not seem to have the correct equipment to treat anything! He's an internist but claims to not have the equipment to diagnose or treat anything that his professional title would suggest. In fact, I recently drove from my home in Chicago to an appointment in Joliet at his office to get a simple check up and blood drawn. When we were about ten minutes away, we called to politely inform them we were running 5-10 minutes late. We were told that would be fine and thanks for calling. When we arrived, He absolutely refused to see us, first stating it was because we were late, and then we were told that he doesn't deal with Chronic pain anyways. We were a little shocked because we were not there for anything to do with chronic pain. The nurse then went in the back, and she did do her best to try and get us in the appointment that was scheduled for us. She came back and said my wife had mentioned I had a stomach ache when she made the appointment. An internist that doesn't deal with a tummy ache!? That's considered chronic pain without hearing the patient's symptoms? We then nearly begged to keep our appointment because at least we could get the annual blood work done. Once again she went in the back to try and help us obtain what we had scheduled, what we drove 40 miles one way for, as well as my wife taking a half a day off of work for, and she came back and told us his response was, ""There's an immediate care center down the street""!! As we sat there in the waiting room waiting for the nurse to run back and forth with each new excuse, we literally watched the next 5 patients come check in, each starting every introduction with, ""I'm sorry I'm so late.""! So instead of just simply finding a new Dr., I decided to write this review to hopefully save someone else the time of waiting, being treated unimportant, and possibly being prescribed a wrong medication. In conclusion, Dr. Brian Ragona is in the wrong field. His true calling is working at 1-800 doctors so that he can tell you everywhere else to go. Dr Ragona is prescribing suboxone, aderol and xanex to an obvious drug user in my family. He's a drug pusher. Could care less about the health and safety of patients. Filed a complaint with Joliet police department and IDFPR!! Dr. Ragona was easy to talk to and listened to my complaints. However, wait time was unacceptable - almost 2 hours. I will say he was worth the wait, but I hope I won't wait as long during my next visit. never on time or he justs cancels all together never reads charts and believes just to prescribe uneeded meds is the answer beware of him since I left him I have gotten off of almost 80% of the medications dropped 70 pounds and feel great What a wonderful man, it is so relieving to know your health is in good hands. This doctor has not only correctly diagnosed my current problems but also aided me in relieving symptoms to other issues that would have become major problems. As my primary Physician, Dr Ragona took a long time explaining to my wife and I the odds, prognosis and probable outcome of two separate diagnosed cancers. The first was cured thru a nephrectomy and the second in remission thanks to ongoing chemo. The man has seen my family and I thru some very scary times and has been beyond the call in terms of compassion and explaining things in ways we can comprehend. A terrific Doctor. I would highly recommended Dr. Brian Ragona. He has served as primary physician for two generations of my family. He is most knowledgable, understanding and caring. He's a good listener and is able to describe/translate medical concepts in a manner understandable to me. He doesn't rush you through an appointment. Because his practice is so busy, it's sometimes difficult to get an appointment on short notice, but the two nurse practioners, Mary and Delia, have always been available when I needed attention. Dr. Ragona has helped me with chronic lung problems as well as annual exams or acute illnesses that may come up. He makes me feel very comfortable in his care. The entire staff at his practice, Optima Medical Associates, is the best I've ever experienced. They're professional, knowledgeable, friendly and always great me by name with a smile on my face. I recommend Dr. Ragona to anyone who is looking for expert medical care as a primary physician or for acute illness. Very knowledgable in his field and very eager to help patients. We were so happy to find a doctor who cares about our well being. During my visit I felt that I was treated very well.I would absolutely recommend this doctor to my family and friends.I felt this visit was an amazing success!Overall I would rate this visit :

", Male,4.04,"I would not reccomend this Dr. to a dog. I had total hip replacement due to accident and he was the Dr. who did my surgery. I never saw Dr. Lawrence after the day he did surgery, only residents. I was told at the hospital that I would start physical therapy immediately after discharge (I’d had some while in the hospital) but his office called me at home and refused to authorize PT until I saw the Dr. in 30 days. At that appt. the resident said said I was fine and scheduled a followup apt. In 30 days. At that appt. the resident said same and was going to walk out the door when I started crying and said I walked like a cripple and I was NOT fine and why wasn’t I allowed to go to PT? He said I didn’t have health insurance. I HAVE BLUE CROSS INS! He stepped out and then back in, said there had been a mistake and scheduled me for PT. I went thru 2 VERY PAINFUL series of PT appts to undue the way my body had healed so I could walk without a hugely exaggerated limp. Later I stopped into the office and asked for permission to get a handicapp sticker for the 4 months of winter as I had to park a long distance from my job and walk on icy areas and was petrified of falling again. The receptionist left to ask the Dr. and came back to say no, the Dr. said there was nothing wrong with me. I have nothing good to say about this Dr. or his bungling staff. Never again!!!!!! I'll go to Ann Arbor or Belmont He took very little time to explain details of the surgery and used medical terms that I didn't know and acted very frustrated when I asked any questions. He seemed very intelligent but spoke in terms that the average person could not understand.He never once looked at my incision after my surgery. He suggested that I should be farther along when I went to my follow up appt. because I was wearing the sling he told me to wear until my follow up visit.I was having a lot of pain still which he seemed uninterested in. He had me in P.T. and said following that I didn't need to return to see him unless I had problems. When I had difficulty with pain during P.T. and returning to work I wanted to make another appt. but was told to just continue P.T. and perhaps go see my reg.

We have known 8 others who have had surgery done by Dr. Lawrence & every one of them has recuperated quicker & with less pain than other dr.s we have heard of. My husband and I always highly recommend this guy! He also gave me some suggestions for exercises to do at home after my pt. ended. My pt. Was scheduled by me before my surgery so they did the initial scheduling with him or his excellent staff after my surgery. I have had 2 ACL repairs and surgery to clean up my meniscus. All went very well thanks to the Dr. Lawrence and the top notch PT staff. The PT staff is seriously the best i have ever worked with. I drove 11 hours one way to see him for my last two knee surgeries. His beside manner, like others have mentioned, is more reserved and factual. He is not the warm and fuzzy type, but he's not rude. He explained everything very well, answered questions and clarified details without talking down to my mom and i or making us feel rushed. My office appointments were all pretty much on time. My 3 surgery appointments were late due something taking longer with the surgeries in front of mine. It doesn't bother me, i understand each case is unique. I'd rather he take is time and do it right while he's in there the first time. I didn't mind waiting. I didn't have anything else planned for the day. All in all I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Lawrence and his team. They are fantastic. I had a total knee replacement 14 weeks ago . Dr. Bruce Lawrence did a excellent surgery for me. I found his staff including his physical therapy team to be a great support system in my successful surgery . I would highly recommend him . I believe the reason he runs behind has to do with him not being rude and making sure everyone understands there treatment plans . All questions are answered. If your looking for success Dr. Bruce Lawrence is the man. Dr. Lawrence does exceptionally high quality surgery - you can trust his skills and competency to do complex surgery on the hip, shoulder, or knee. I had hip replacement surgery from Dr. Lawrence and he far exceeded my expectations. Bill Neale Dr Lawrence just did a total knee for me. He answered every question we asked and some we didn't think about! He is very professional and an excellent surgeon. He has also done both my shoulders for turn rotator cuffs. I would recommend him to all very highly I had surgery on both of my shoulders for having torn rotator cuffs back around 2007 by Dr. Lawrence and both of my shoulders came out great. I was going to go to the doctor that operates on the Red Wings, Tigers, etc; but changed my mind & went to Dr. Lawrence and am glad that I did. He did orthoscopic surgery on me instead of making a big incision which is better & you heal faster. He is not real personable but did a great job on me. I would recommend him for surgery for shoulders for sure. I was in a auto accident 2003 and I had major fractures in my lower extemities.I'm glad I had him for a surgeon he is the best. Extremely proficient in surgery and completely attentive during follow-up exams. Demeanor on the serious side; nothing wrong with that. Takes necessary time to adequately answer all questions in clear, concise manner while not engaging in small-talk or unnecessary chatter. Does everything you would expect a busy, highly competent doctor to do. I had total knee replacement in 2007 and it has been completely successful!. I have recommended Dr. Lawrence to several people and will continue to do so. Dr Lawrence is a phenomenal surgeon. He is very knowledgeable and knows his stuff. He explains what you need to have done and gives you options without pressuring you. He is the best ortho surgeon in the State... This surgeon is outstanding!

He has supported me through the highs and lows of various medical conditions and I hope to continue receiving his guidance for years to come. I always receive good specialty recommendations as well. Dr. Samarian truly cares about his patients. He is very truthful, tells it like it is, but always to help the patient be in good health. My husband and I will continue having him for our Internal Medicine Dr. even though we are now described as ""geriatric patients"". I have been a patient for20+ years and he is a fantastic physician. Great doctor, great sense of humor, great follow-up. I can't imagine seeing a different doctor. We have been patients of this Dr. for many years and he continually inspires us to stay in good health. His sense of humor is contagious and his knowledge is awesome. Lisa, his receptionist/assn't is always efficent and pleasant, as is Patty who answers the phones. We are proud to be patients of this fine physician. My husband and I cannot speak highly enough about Dr. Samarian and his staff. This Dr. goes out of his way to listen to you, and always with patience and a sense of humor, which is so appreciated by a patient. We highly recommend Dr. Samarian to anyone who wants a caring, up-to-date physician that you can always reach! Thanks to all at this office for that you do for the patients. I have been going to Dr. Bruce Samarian for about 15 years. My mother and her boyfriend recommended him. Now I couldn't imagine seeing anyone else. He won't **** you, he will tell it like it is. If you need to lose weight, try some new medication, take a test, or do anything you may be uncomfortable with or afraid of, he will not hesitate to tell you what you need to do for yourself. He's funny, a wonderful listener, and extremely knowledgeable. Once he develops a good raport with you, and you can't come in due to work schedule, or finances, he will be sure to contact you before the end of his workday. Lisa, his main nurse and front scheduler is amazing as well. Anything you need, she will take care of it. I don't know if he accepts any new patients anymore, but I would highly recommend him to anyone. My husband and I have been going to Dr. Bruce Samarian for many years. He and his staff are very unique and knowledgeable in the respect that if you need him, he is always there for you. Phone calls are returned the same day and if need be, you can get in to see him that same day, which is not the case with many other Doctors. As a diagnostician, he can't be beat. I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone needing an outstanding Internal Medicine Dr. who also happens to have compassion and possesses a good sense of humor as well. I also might add that his staff will go out of their way for you and this is so important from a patient's point of view. I give top rating to this Doctor and his staff.

Look up his history on google, you will see the truth. Just stay away from this horrible person. Took my call about my symptoms.

I had no heart damage because of his quick action. Extremely knowledgeable and patient orientated doctor","Cared for my relative for years with advanced heart failure. Coordinated with other specialists and helped him get much out of life when others wanted to give up on him. Very caring and answered calls and letters. Dr. Craig Vinch is an amazingly terrific doctor. He's one of the kindest, calm and helpful physicians I've ever met. He takes the time to get to know you and offers his expertise and advice in a way that the patient can best receive it. Recently I was in the ER and was extremely scared by information delivered by the head ER physician, who shared a potential challenging diagnosis, without adequate information. Dr. Vinch came in a few minutes later, completely calmed me down, told me I simply needed to have several more tests and that he would be back to see me later in the day. All turned out very well and I didn't have anything wrong. I will always remain so grateful to Dr. Vinch and consider him among the finest physicians I know. He's terrific! Great bedside manner. He's truly interested in you as a person and a patient. Really outstanding doctor. Dr Vinch is a fantastic doctor and person. He is calm, knowledgable and through. He takes the time to learn about you and your life. He and his staff are accomodating when necesary and always excessable. I feel very fortunate to be in such good hands!

He listens and will look at information bought in off the internet and consider it and go from there takes all things into consideration for treating you Dr. Was the best one I've ever been to! I will continue to see him as long as I can. I have been a patient of Dr Marcowitz for the last 15 years, and I am very pleased with the care I have received. The only suggestion I would have is Dr Marcowitz needs to hire another doctor to help with his patient load. Very Busy Physician, but an excellent Doctor. Great bedside care, and listens to me as a patient. He never seems ""rushed"", although his office is busy. His staff is very friendly and knowledgeable also. I have been a patient of Dr Marcowitz since 1997. My wife and I like Dr Marcowitz because he listens to what we have to say. He is also the only doctor we know of that gives his patients his home phone, as well as his personal cell phone in the event we have an emergency. He also treats all of his patients alike. Unlike some doctors who look down on those who are on public aid. We feel Dr Marcowitz is special, and we would gladly travel 100 of miles to see him. My wife and I have been going to Dr Marcowitz for 7 years. He is very caring and down to earth. He treats all of his patients the same, regardless if you have insurance or not. He have always been extremly helpfull with medication samples. If doctor Marcowitz was to move his practace outside the Quad Cities, we would gladly travel to see him.

43,Dr. David M. Grganto,Illinois,physician and surgeon license placed on indefinite probation for a minimum of two years must complete 30 Continuing Medical Education hours and fined $5000 due to inappropriately prescribing controlled substances to several patients of his practice., Male,4.11,Will not call back patients even when test results are bad. Asked to call back and the nurse calls. Can't get the Dr. to call. Leaves patients uninformed and scared.,"The best dr I've had, he takes great care of his pts. Dr Grganto is the best, unfortunately Northwestern Hospital thinks there are 3 of that poor man. I have been going to him for about 15 years. He is patient, kind and caring. His employer cares about money, money,money. He should open his own practice. He would be one rich man!!!!!!!! I was really impressed with Dr Grganto's bedside manner. Ive been accused of lying by a doctor, so the mistrust was there, but this man really listened and took my complaints seriously. That alone makes him unique in this aspect. He made me feel hopeful again, which after living with chronic, debilitating pain for a few years now, is nearly impossible. I left Dr Grganto's office feeling relieved. I believed him when he said he would figure out what is going on in my body. I was so comfortable talking to him and was able to be completely honest without fear he'd think I was exaggerating or embellishing my experiences with my ever worsening condition. I found myself thanking God out loud, on the car ride home. Granted time will tell, however if I had to rate my experience with Dr Grganto as of now, I'd rate him a 5 out of 5. Best health decision I made for myself, to date! Highly Recommended Caring doctor that thinks outside the box. Willing to dig deep and consult other references (doctors, papers) to get the right answer. Dr. Grganto is a very nice doctor who knows what he's talking about and cuts through the BS to get to the core of the situation. Although he can keep you waiting a bit, he's TOTALLY worth it because when it's your turn, he takes as much time as YOU need. He's absolutely amazing. Have been a patient of Dr. Grganto for about fifteen years. I've been blessed with good health so haven't needed to see him much within that time which seems to be a problem with his staff. Unless you've seen Dr. G within the past three years, getting his staff to relay a message for HIM to call you back and not his staff when you have a question is impossible. I thought being a long time patient would warrant a return phone call directly from the Dr when you ask to speak TO HIM, but Dr. G's staff don't see it that way. Dr. G's staff is missing the importance of the small gestures (i.e., a return phone call) that cultivate a strong Dr/patient relationship. Going to the Dr is the same as securing the services of any other profession; if you're paying for the service, you should expect to talk directly with the individual providing that service. With the aforementioned said, I rate Dr. Grganto and his office a -0-, which is a shame as Dr. Grganto is truly an exceptional doctor. Best Doctor I've ever met! He takes his time with you and explains everything. He doesn't talk down to you or make you feel like you're wasting his time. Wait time can be excessive. But, when it is my turn in the office, I never feel rushed. He always listens and comes up with good solutions. He saved my dad's life. My dad had kidney failure and Dr. G called my house late at night because the test results had just come in and my dad had to go to the hospital immediately. I love Dr. Grganto. He makes you feel at ease and genuinely cares about his patients. He also likes to know how you are doing in general and not just what ails you. VERY VERY nice and easy to get along with. The perfect doctor. Very nice doctor, took his time to talk to me, I didn't feel rushed.

44,Dr. David S. Larsen,Illinois,physician and surgeon license reprimanded and must take and pass all five (5) topic areas of Ethics and Boundaries Post-Licensure Essay Examination due to prescribing medications for family members., Male,3.3,"Dr. Larsen is a thief and his staff are heartless idiots. Beware. He, without permission, charged my Dad $25 for a mistake made by Larsen himself, ""forgetting"" to sign a prescription form, necessitating a second fax. He had the nerve to charge $25 for the second fax. His nurse would not remove a $50 charge for an appointment my Dad missed because he HAD A HEART ATTACK on the morning of his afternoon appointment. I should have disputed the charges and reported this hack. Very knowledgeable about available treatments,old and new. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DOCTOR. All he is concerned about his money. He charged my insurance company 1079 dollars for my initial visit, that is more than an E.R. visit. Since my insurance is out of network, he charged my credit card 550 dollars. He charged me 270.00 for a 15 minute office visit and charges a 25 dollar fee for monthly medication refills Yes, doctors can charge for their services, but when the doctor is the one who messed up, then charges the patient, THAT is plain wrong. He neglected to sign a prescription for my Mother which was faxed to Arizona. The pharmacy called my Mother to tell they could not fill the prescription because Larsen did not sign it. When Larsen had to fax the prescription a second time because of HIS error, he charged my parents $25.00. Is this ethical?? Personally, I see this as a possible way to scam, and I find it despicable. I'm so glad to be rid of him. If I ever require a neurologist, you can bet I'll look elsewhere. Dr Larsen's practice seems to be more important to collect fees not related to medical problems. Charge for missed appointments, calling in prescriptions, not bringing current medications every visit. His diagnoses of my illness was accurate but the follow up diagnoses was not. He once prescribed a medication that the pharmacy refused to fill because it could become toxic. His office staff;s comment was they didn't know I was taking the other medication. Dr. Larsen's comment was since he did not prescribe the other medication he could not change it. I believe Dr. Larsen is cold and has little feeling for his paients. Save yourself time and $$$. This could be the worst ""Dr"" in Illinois. After speaking to several other Neurologists - they call him the ""The Big Quack"" bc he has no idea what he's doing and send Big Bills plus no other MDs will work with him - has been kicked out of several groups!!! It is amazing a medical school let this person graduate! His knowledge base was pathetic and his bedside manner even worse!!! After doing some research, I found many feel the same way. GO TO A REAL MD THAT KNOWN WHAT THEY ARE DOING!!!!","Dr. Larsen has so much personal experience with migraines and always has a new solution up his sleeve. He's heard it all, is super smart, and can make you feel better with a laugh too. I was bedridden for 2 years until I saw him and am now walking at my high school school graduation this month. I've been seeing him for 2 years and plan on continuing. We have been seeing Dr. Larsen for over 2 years. He has been treating my husband for chronic migraines and we have actually had success in pain management as well as decreasing the frequency and intensity of the migraines. He is very knowledgeable and is always looking to the latest medical information available. I would highly recommend him. I find he is very caring and takes time to listen to what you have to say. He does charge for missed appointments and for refills he has to call in but I figure he is running a business. Dr. Larsen is excellent and we highly recommend him. Very knowledgeable and caring. He's the best, listens to what you have to say. Explains things so you can understand. Love this Dr. Dr Larsen has helped me tremendously.

His diagnosis and treatment was accurate and effective. His knowledge and treatments are state of the art. I would definitely suggest Dr Larsen to someone

suffering from chronic headaches. I see a good number of specialists for a number of aging issues. Unlike the others who are only interested in working with conditions specific to their specialty, Dr Larson has been able to listen to me as one patient with multiple conditions and explain to me the big picture. His recommendations are sound and his explanations help me understand and manage my health the way no other physician could. He is one excellent neurologist but he is also more than that. He is the doctor how everyone would wish a doctor to be. He does have knowledge, but....his personality extremely brusque. He has spoken 'down' to me and members of my family on several occasions and it is irritating. But, my Dad likes him and he treats my Dad well. For myself, if I ever need a neurologist, I will look elsewhere. Also be prepared to wait a LONG time for your appointment. If you need to phone him for any reason, he will not hide his displeasure. Our idea of an emergency and his are apparently very different. Dr. Larsen is very knowledgeable and has a caring and patient personality. At my initial consultation he spent over 45 minutes with me making sure he did a thorough history and exam. Also I work at a local hospital and all the staff there recommended him as well. He does require a credit card on file, but that is not unusual in light of the poor medical reimbursement these days. Dr. Larsen is an excellent neurologist. Most doctors require a credit card nowadays. You really can't blame them for trying to recover what they are rightfully due. It is a business, after all. They have overhead and employees to pay, plus Medicare reimbursement continues to dwindle. I for one am glad I found Dr. Larsen. I think he is an excellent neurologist. Beware, this guy requires a credit card imprint on file. Should your card expire, they will ask for another one immediately. And they charge for ""duplicate prescriptions"". Just beware...office manager is a viper. This man is awesome! He trained with the best. He specializes in headaches, EEG's and EMG's. I chose him even though my insurance won't cover him, I feel that strongly that he knows what he is doing. He is very personable and likeable. You will be in good hands.",7.0,11.0,19, laren thief taff heartle idiot beware without permiion charged dad 25 mitake made laren forgetting ign precription form neceitating econd fax nerve charge 25 econd fax nure would remove 50 charge appointment dad mied heart attack morning afternoon appointment diputed charge reported hack knowledgeable available treatmentold new tay away doctor concerned money charged inurance company 1079 dollar initial viit er viit ince inurance network charged credit card 550 dollar charged 27000 15 minute office viit charge 25 dollar fee monthly medication refill ye doctor charge ervice doctor one meed charge patient plain wrong neglected ign precription mother faxed arizona pharmacy called mother tell could fill precription laren ign laren fax precription econd time error charged parent 2500 ethical peronally ee poible way cam find depicable im glad rid ever require neurologit bet ill look elewhere  laren practice eem important collect fee related medical problem charge mied appointment calling precription bringing current medication every viit diagnoi illne accurate follow diagnoi precribed medication pharmacy refued fill could become toxic office taff comment didnt know taking medication  laren comment ince precribe medication could change believe  laren cold little feeling paient ave time could wort  illinoi peaking everal neurologit call big quack bc idea he end big bill plu md work kicked everal group amazing medical chool let peron graduate knowledge bae pathetic bedide manner even wore reearch found many feel way go real md known, laren much peronal experience migraine alway new olution leeve he heard uper mart make feel better laugh beidden 2 year aw walking high chool chool graduation month ive eeing 2 year plan continuing eeing  laren 2 year treating huband chronic migraine actually ucce pain management well decreaing frequency intenity migraine knowledgeable alway looking latet medical information available would highly recommend find caring take time liten ay charge mied appointment refill call figure running buine  laren excellent highly recommend knowledgeable caring he bet liten ay explain thing undertand love   laren helped tremendouly diagnoi treatment accurate effective knowledge treatment tate art would definitely ugget  laren omeone uffering chronic headache ee good number pecialit number aging iue unlike other intereted working condition pecific pecialty  laron able liten one patient multiple condition explain big picture recommendation ound explanation help undertand manage health way phyician could one excellent neurologit alo doctor everyone would wih doctor knowledge buthi peronality extremely bruque poken member family everal occaion irritating dad like treat dad well ever need neurologit look elewhere alo prepared wait long time appointment need phone reaon hide dipleaure idea emergency apparently different  laren knowledgeable caring patient peronality initial conultation pent 45 minute making ure thorough hitory exam alo work local hopital taff recommended well require credit card file unuual light poor medical reimburement day  laren excellent neurologit doctor require credit card nowaday really cant blame trying recover rightfully due buine overhead employee pay plu medicare reimburement continue dwindle one glad found  laren think excellent neurologit beware guy require credit card imprint file card expire ak another one immediately charge duplicate precription bewareoffice manager viper man aweome trained bet pecialize headache eeg emg choe even though inurance wont cover feel trongly know peronable likeable good hand,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.001361352,0.857,1,1,0,0,0
45,Dr. David Wong,Michigan,Sister State Disciplinary Action , Male,4.12,"Dr. Wong gave up on me. On my second to last visit. I was recieving laser on my right eye and it became very painful for me and I could not continue. He then became upset and seemed to have a bit of a tantrum then abruptly asked if I had any pain killers at home to use next time I came in. On my last visit before going in I had taken two extra strength Tynolol to prepare myself. After waiting for over two hours I went to ask the nurse how much longer it would be and she replied two more hours, I told her I could'nt wait and to please reschedule. Its been about three months now and no one has called. I guess he had no intention of seeing me on that last visit. Arrogant and rude. Thinks hes smarter than other people, asked him a question, and he answered and i just repeated what hebsaid to reconfirm i understood properly, and then tells me ""thats what i just said, you need to be smarter than that' in such a rude and condescending way. Do notbreccommend this doc at all. This guy is terrible. He let the student take over. The student left stucks in my eyes for a half hour. And gave me a bad eye drop medication. Because of the student i have svars on my Corneas. And this dr Wong mocked me. Saying. It""s our turn and laughed. No wonder people are goung blind. This rating is not for Dr. Wong it's for Sharron the assistant. A surgery for a patient was needed to be done in a week according to the referring doctor. I called after 2 weeks to see when the patient is due for surgery. The only thing she represted over and over is that the doctor will be back in a week and a half. She denied having taken the report, thought I saw that myself or ever spoken to regarding the case. She never asked about the patient's name to even check., and said we have to wait until the other assistant comes back from leave next week. She laughed at me when I asked what should be done in her opinion and kept repeating the Dr is not here . She later apologized when I said she can't laugh at people, she said she meant to get her point across by laughing. why don't good doctors pick good assistants? Dr. Wong gave up on me. On my second to last visit. I was recieving laser on my right eye and it became very painful for me and I could not continue. He then became upset and seemed to have a bit of a tantrum then abruptly asked if I had any pain killers at home to use next time I came in. On my last visit before going in I had taken two extra strength Tynolol to prepare myself. After waiting for over two hours I went to ask the nurse how much longer it would be and she replied two more hours, I told her I could'nt wait and to please reschedule. Its been about three months now and no one has called. I guess he had no intention of seeing me on that last visit. Arrogant and rude. Thinks hes smarter than other people, asked him a question, and he answered and i just repeated what hebsaid to reconfirm i understood properly, and then tells me ""thats what i just said, you need to be smarter than that' in such a rude and condescending way. Do notbreccommend this doc at all. This guy is terrible. He let the student take over. The student left stucks in my eyes for a half hour. And gave me a bad eye drop medication. Because of the student i have svars on my Corneas. And this dr Wong mocked me. Saying. It""s our turn and laughed. No wonder people are goung blind. This rating is not for Dr. Wong it's for Sharron the assistant. A surgery for a patient was needed to be done in a week according to the referring doctor. I called after 2 weeks to see when the patient is due for surgery. The only thing she represted over and over is that the doctor will be back in a week and a half.

His Fellows are amazing and I feel lucky to have had the team for my detached retina and two years later vitrectomy. They saved my

Vision. Smart man. Knows what he's doing but highly unresponsive. I left multiple messages with his staff who were kind and caring and were apologetic and he never responded. I ended up going to ER and they were the ones that got his attention. Shouldn't be that way. I'm having trouble with my eye again - losing vision, warped letters and lines - and AGAINE All I am saying is do not accept new patient if you are overbooked. You want to help the patient, be honest with them. My earlier visits were handled by his associates, not him. I got fed up and decided to go elsewhere. Luckily, I found a specialist who is responsive, and hands-on to his patients. Amazing dr but if you have appointment at noon your lucky to get seen by late afternoon! Four hour wait not unusual? Can understand falling behind but hours of a wait each visit???! I fully agree with so many of David Wong’s patients in their reviews that he deserves more then 5 stars. He is so kind, comfortable to be with and so very competent - renowned in his field for excellence. Your a very fortunate person to be in his care. Dr. Wong is amazing. I was having an anxiety attack because I was losing my vision. I was at ER at St. Mike's three times before they took my symtom,s seriously. I was also sent to another opthamologist in the same hospital who prescribed me new reading glasses and had said my eyes were ""just aging"". On my 4th visit I was sent to Dr. Wong and he gave me a possible diagnosis. Later that night I was admitted because I had lost all vision in both eyes. Dr. Wong eased my worries and told me ""leave the worrying to us"". My vision isn't 100% yet but I do have faith in Dr. Wong that I will gain most, if not all of it back. Professional, caring even under tremendous pressure. I developed a macular hole sometime during covid. Dr Wong did a vitreous procedure to close the hole and it was successful. When he showed me the scan of my eye - he was genuinely happy with the results and for me. He has a great personality and is caring. I watched and listened how he spoke to people who were waiting for their person. He was thorough and explained things in language people could understand. What impressed me most - was an elderly woman - was having a serious issue. Before Dr Wong could speak to her son - he peaked out of the room and gave her son a thumbs up. How incredibly kind a small sign as that could ease your mind. If I could give him 6 stars that would be appropriate! Brilliant, caring and dedicated. Truly loves his work. Saved my vision time after time! I had a total detached retina in my right eye I was blind with no vision at all he performed numerous procedures at St Mike's and my final operation at Oakville the operation was a success and happy to say approximately 8 years later I still have my vision . Thank you Dr Wong!!! Great doctor. Fixed the problems my wife had after cateract surgery. I had eye surgery done by Dr WONG, great surgeon went to see him in Sept of this year ,surgery done three days later , today was another follow up appointment and I have great vision He gave me my eye sight back , Thanks Wong from a thankful

 patient in Oakville No question. This man saved my eyesight period. I had a retinal detachment due to diabetic retinopathy and he was with me through 2 vitrectomies and multiple lasers. He can be blunt at times yes, mainly because he's overworked and he's trying to help so many people at once. But I owe him my life and my eyesight. I am now living outside of Canada and my retinal specialist where I live looked at the back of my eyes and said the work done was some of the best he'd ever seen. Thank you Dr. Wong. God bless you and your staff! I had suffered RD Mac off suddenly. Dr Juncal was on call that night and I had the most thorough and compassionate care. Followup was with Dr Wong who was very nice, took the time and was very personable. His staff keep him on track and are very efficient and lovely! My vision was saved thanks to these Doctors!! Dr. Wong took care of my father-in-law who had an emergency retinal detachment during his visit to Canada to watch his daughter graduate. Dr. Wong went above and beyond the call of duty and even provided connections to North Carolina Ophthalmologists to ensure we were well taken care of. Performed a very complicated EMERGENCY eye surgery on my husband today BETWEEN his other surgeries. That called at 11pm tonight, HIMSELF, to see how my husband was doing! How many surgeons take the time to do that?!?! This man is the BEST in his field and an OUTSTANDING human being!

Georgetown ON Dr. David Wong is excellent and the doctors working with him are really good. The staff is excellent, hard working and extremely polite. I am really happy with the treatment. Thanks. A very sincere thank you to Doctor David Wong & associates. The doctor performed a very difficult surgery on my right eye that no one else would attempt. The operation was a complete success. My vision has been restored and I am back to my normal activities. Nothing short of miraculous. Once again, thanks to the Doc! 10 out of 10!

Hamilton, Ontario If you want world class competence, see Dr. Wong and his staff. If you want warm fuzzy feelings, buy a puppy. Excellent Doctor and wonderful staff. Successfully treating my family member for a rare eye condition. Well worth the wait for first rate care. Dr. Wong is the best specialist in his field. He is honest, answers all questions and I am glad that he is my doctor. He saved my right eye. I was diagnosed with Mac off Retinal detachment in my left eye by Dr Varun Chaudhry in Burlington who sent me to Dr Wong the next day. Dr Wong saw me BETWEEN surgeries at St Mikes and said he could do my surgery the NEXT day. Survey was successful and my eye is still in the healing stage. He is intelligent, experienced and answers all my questions without rushing me. He saved my vision. The best, humble, caring, professional doctor we have ever met, God bless him He completed eye surgery on both eyes of my step daughter and was successful bringing her from ""legally blind"" to being able to see about 50% better then before. Reattached retina in both eyes and cleared scar tissue and blood build up. He and his staff were fantastic and very supportive and helpful and knowledgeable. Twice within the last decade he fit me in to his busy schedule and saved my vision both times, would wait what ever time required to have him treat my family or my self. Simply the best I think the only fundamental issue is - did the eye issue get resolved, or was treatment as successful as possible. David is exceptional. Sure, there may be a bit of a wait, but that tells me that he is at the top of his game. I have been through much more that most with both eyes over the past several yEars and without question, he is the only person that I trust with my eyes.

49,Dr. Donald E. Harrell,Minnesota,Drug Diversion; Negligence-Incompetence; echnical Violation of the Michigan PHC, Male,1.34,"As I read other people's comments I notice a common theme, which I have experienced every time I have to see him, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get him to stop talking long enough for you, the patient to communicate any concerns, questions or how you are feeling/doing. He talks non stop and its subjects that have nothing to do with why you are there, it's very frustrating. Once I had to raise my voice and slam my fist on the table and ask him to please stop talking long enough for me to convey what I wanted to communicate. Even if you have an appointment, you will be lucky to be seen in an hour to 90 minutes from your scheduled time. I honestly think he forgets he saw you the week before because with my insurance every month I have to get a prior auth and to get my meds covered I have to go on a generic version of the meds until medicaid receives a drug test and then approves covering the name brand meds, so....I have asked Dr Harrell, when the prior auth comes back approved can he simply call downstairs to Sanus pharmacy, or take the 30 seconds to write the script for the name brand, but NO...even though he just saw me a week ago, he will insist I have another full hour long appointment, and since I would not be on the schedule that day he has to quote ""fit me in"" which in other words means waiting potentially the entire day, just for a script, keep in mind if you have to work that day or have anything else important going on, and you try to explain this to him, he doesn't care, in fact he has often acted like what you say does not even compute with him, like he is lost in his own world, and forget about his staff being sympathetic or intervening to help, they give a darn less than him, they are often short with you, rude and seem stressed or exasperated, no doubt from having to deal with him 4 days a week. I will reiterate it is IMPOSSIBLE to get him to listen to you, to do so means you have to practically scream at the top of your lungs as I had to once in pure frustration, and then he and his staff will tell you how rude you are being and threaten to cancel your appointment. I will say I think he means well as far as being an advocate for people being treated for addiction but that is his only good quality. If you are a suboxone patient, make an attempt to find another suboxone doctor, even with there being few in this area, and if you are looking for a doctor for any other reason, stay away from this practice unless you want to be angry and frustrated, and not listened to. I honestly do not know if he has some condition, like ADD or dementia, but I am looking for another docotr because I often wonder if someone called the AMA (American Medical Association) and someone came in to evaluate him, I think he would be closed down, I am surprised every month that something like that hasn't happened yet. I unfortunately have to see him on a regular basis as I am in Suboxone and he is one of the few doctors that prescribe it, if I have a 2 pm appointment I'm lucky if I am seen by 3:15, no joke, two African American women in his office are rude and unprofessional. But THEE WORST THING is he talks and talks and talks, and none of it is related to you THE PATIENT. I think he is either adult ADHD or has dementia. I have never been able to discuss an issue I WANT to discuss, he is impossible to redirect. Once I tried talking about my insomnia and he responded by talking about a medical conference he went to at U of M, I mean seriously. If you are a Suboxone patient try to find another doctor, if you just need a family doctor or OCC med doctor, I KNOW there are many other normal and SANE doctors in Kalamazoo. He is a quack This is the worst doctor visit i've had in my entire life. I feel very silly for not looking up for reviews before I scheduled a visit with this doctor. I went in for an immigration exam where they charge $350 for basically doing nothing; they make you answer a few questions, you move your limps around and they take a blood test. Except a week later I find out that I have to pay for the lab result, as well which they did not mention even though I asked them about five time how much the exam would cost me. The staff, there is an older woman, she is extremely rude and threatened me on the phone she would notify USCIS about me not paying, even though I had already paid $350 and did not understand why the lab result was not covered. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, avoid this doctor and the rude staff in all cost. The doctor is equally uncaring, he was talking non-stop about race and other wrid issues and did not even ask me how I was feeling. Please, look up another doctor even if it is further away and spare yourself the frustration, this place is NOT worth your money and time. This Office is terrible and the Doctor needs help. Was forgotten TWICE in the hearing booth by the office staff - once with the headset squealing in my ears for half an hour. Was treated poorly by the doctor. He was rough, didn't wash his hands, didn't wear gloves and repeated exams multiple times as if he hadn't done them before. We sent our employees here for their DOT this week. All of them complained. Our last person waited 2.5 hours just to see the doctor. During this time the doctor was helping the receptionist with tax issue and 3 other clients came in complaining of lost paper work. When I called to complain about our employee's wait I was told he was lying. Everyone complained about the doctor's crazy non related stories...oh...and he doesn't use gloves during exams. I totally concur with the 2 previous comments. He was rude, and babbled on about things which I had no interest. I was there for a DOT physical, which should have been completed in short order. Instead I had to jump through hoops for him and return another day with more information on my diabetes from my physician in another state. I was just trying to describe to some friends my 2 experiences with Dr Harrell. I think he's a lunatic. My first physical took 3 hours (he was doing occupational work cases at the same time). My second physical took about an hour, but most of that time was listening to his crazy stories and rants. I am a pilot who sought a first class medical certificate from Dr. Harrell. Dr. Harrell is an FAA certified Senior Aviation Medical Examiner. He was at a complete loss as to how to handle the fact that I indicated I had a history of motion sickness and ended up getting the FAA headquarters in Oklahoma City involved. The matter is still pending and may end my career as a professional aviator. I personally had a hard time communicating with Dr. Harrell as he talked about his vacation to upstate New York and other completely unrelated medical cases and philosophical anecdotes rather than MY PERSONAL CASE. As I read other people's comments I notice a common theme, which I have experienced every time I have to see him, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get him to stop talking long enough for you, the patient to communicate any concerns, questions or how you are feeling/doing. He talks non stop and its subjects that have nothing to do with why you are there, it's very frustrating. Once I had to raise my voice and slam my fist on the table and ask him to please stop talking long enough for me to convey what I wanted to communicate. Even if you have an appointment, you will be lucky to be seen in an hour to 90 minutes from your scheduled time. I honestly think he forgets he saw you the week before because with my insurance every month I have to get a prior auth and to get my meds covered I have to go on a generic version of the meds until medicaid receives a drug test and then approves covering the name brand meds, so....I have asked Dr Harrell, when the prior auth comes back approved can he simply call downstairs to Sanus pharmacy, or take the 30 seconds to write the script for the name brand, but NO...even though he just saw me a week ago, he will insist I have another full hour long appointment, and since I would not be on the schedule that day he has to quote ""fit me in"" which in other words means waiting potentially the entire day, just for a script, keep in mind if you have to work that day or have anything else important going on, and you try to explain this to him, he doesn't care, in fact he has often acted like what you say does not even compute with him, like he is lost in his own world, and forget about his staff being sympathetic or intervening to help, they give a darn less than him, they are often short with you, rude and seem stressed or exasperated, no doubt from having to deal with him 4 days a week. I will reiterate it is IMPOSSIBLE to get him to listen to you, to do so means you have to practically scream at the top of your lungs as I had to once in pure frustration, and then he and his staff will tell you how rude you are being and threaten to cancel your appointment. I will say I think he means well as far as being an advocate for people being treated for addiction but that is his only good quality. If you are a suboxone patient, make an attempt to find another suboxone doctor, even with there being few in this area, and if you are looking for a doctor for any other reason, stay away from this practice unless you want to be angry and frustrated, and not listened to.

55,Dr. Edward Paloyan,Illinois,physician and surgeon license placed in refuse to renew status due to his failure to respond to the Department following the receipt of a mandatory report., Male,4.11,"This doctor wants to do surgery, adn will charge you twice what the insurance company will pay.

He does not care about your health. I had the WORST experience with this doctor. After discussing my symptoms, he said he’d test me for Hashimoto disease but my symptoms were exactly opposite of Hashimoto disease. Was he thinking about dinner or whatever as he obviously wasn’t listening. I have been a patient for 14 yrs. I was happy until this year. I was not feeling well and was loosing lots of hair. I called the office to ask if I could get checked. I was told it was my age (46) and turned away. Another one of my doctors did blood work changed my meds. I felt better and my hair loss stopped. I went in for my annual ultrasound and check up. He was upset with the meds my other doctor prescribed and said that I am lucky I am not in a morgue from cardiac arrest. He insisted very egotisically that my problems were from my age and when I asked questions he told me the thyroid is too complicated for me to understand. That was my last appointment with this sexist, egotistical, hard of hearing doctor. He is the one who is old. I have been a patient of Dr. Paloyan since early 2000 and was very pleased with the outcome of my diagnosis with him that was mis-diagnosed by a previous Dr. and I can not express how grateful I am to him for that. I do have to agree with some of the comments about him not listening to what you say about how you feel. I am tired of him telling me I am getting older. The thyroid is a tiny organ that controls so much and without one and relying on a pill I don't always feel is enough. My levels are fine but what about what my body is saying?? Is there something else that I should be doing:( I have been tired and have had no energy and suffer from depression since I had my thyroid removed. I wish there was a transplant!! I stopped going to Dr. Paloyan because I felt he was not listening to my symptoms and issues I had related to my hypothyroidism. I was very disappointed seeing that he got such good reviews here. The office staff is really unpleasant. After you see the doctor you are sent to see the billing department at which time they try to get money from you. I had a big issue with incorrect billing to insurance I brought in all the insurance paperwork but in the end I ended up paying what they wanted, which was incorrect. I had to take blood tests every few months which gets to be really expensive even with insurance. The thyroid medicine the doctor gave me is expensive and hard to get. The pharmacist even questioned why he would be prescribing this particular medicine. I decided not to return after approximately a year and now am monitored by my regular internal medicine doctor. Sad is my major comment - i read all these others but i did not have this experience and i've been going for several years. He completely ignores anything i say about how i feel, he only checks my levels once a year even if i change meds or dosage - never ever checked bone density and i'm in menopause. he refused to discuss how i have no energy and my bones hurt, i started getting broken bones, my eyes lids were swelling, weight gain...he said the levels were fine and i didn't need anything else. SOOOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! DURING MY TREATMENT FOR AUTOIMMUNE HASHIMOTO/'S THYROIDITIS, TUMORS BEGAN TO ENLARGE AND BLOOD WORK AND BIOPSY INDICATED CHANGES. PARTIAL THYROIDECTOMY WAS RECOMMENDED. I WENT TO ANOTHER ENDO DR AND TRIED TO GET A 2ND OPINION. THE 2ND DR WAS VERBALLY ABUSIVE TOWARD DR. PALOYAN AND TOLD ME HE WAS TOO AGGRESSIVE IN TREATMENT. HE REVIEWED MY ENTIRE MEDICAL FILE AND STILL DID NOT CONCUR RE SURGERY. HE WANTED ME TO OBTAIN FOR HIM THE ACTUAL SLIDE OF THE BIOPSY (WE ALL KNOW HOW POSSIBLE THAT IS). I CALLED 2ND DR/'S OFFICE SEVERAL TIMES AND HE NEVER GOT BACK TO ME. DATE OF SURGERY ARRIVED AND I UNDERWENT A SUCCESSFUL PROCEDURE. THERE WAS CANCER FOUND. IT HAD NOT SPREAD. TODAY I AM STILL SEEING DR. PALOYAN AND VERY HAPPY WITH ALL FACETS OF HIS TREATMENT.","I came into the office yesterday morning and politely asked Kelly, the receptionist, where the bathroom was because I had eaten something that morning that upset my stomach and that I may need to throw up. After she told me where they are, she proceeded to tell the rest of the ladies behind her what I had told her. Next, Susan, one of the nurses, proceeded to try to kick me out of the office. Yes, that’s right. She told me I needed to leave because there were auto immune compromised people in their office. May I remind you, I am not sick at all. I simply ate something (and I know exactly what I ate) that made me sick. Hence, I am not sick at all and do not have the flu. I am very sensitive when I’m sick and if I even have a small headache I would cancel an appointment. Needless to say I felt perfectly fine besides that. Susan was extremely rude and tried to kick me out of the office blindly multiple times. I explained to her I wasn’t sick and she proceeded to yell at me still. I told her if she’s going to kick me out of the office then I at least want to know my results. She REFUSED completely to let me see my test results and told me I have to come back. Refusing to give someone their results has to either be illegal or against some medical law. I have growths on my thyroid and I don’t take that lightly. I just wanted to see my results and she kept refusing to give them to me. She finally brought me into a room and asked me a few questions then I waited for the doctor. I saw the doctor for about 5-10 minutes. I could have gotten my results super quickly but she refused. I wouldn’t have even had to go back into the office if I saw my results. Once I had left the office, I called the office to get the name of the nurse (Susan) so I could email Dr. Paloyan and tell him what had happened. Kelly, the receptionist, picked up the phone. I got Susans name and was going to hang up when Kelly added, “and just so you know, my husband is going through chemotherapy and if he’s exposed to the flu he could die”. First off, I do not have the flu. I ate something that upset my stomach. Those two are NOT the same thing. Second, I got the flu shot and have been healthy. Third, it is so incredibly screwed up and sickening that she felt the need to tell me that if her husband dies, it’s my fault. I don’t know what sick thoughts run through a persons mind that would make them say something like that. If your husband is that sick, then why are you working in a medical building where you’re around sick people all day? I am absolutely outraged at what happened and I am never coming back to this office. Dr. Payloyan is a great man and a fantastic doctor but that’s not enough to get me to stay. I have never experienced anything like this before and I have no idea how Kelly and Susan still have jobs there if this is how they act. Absolutely outrageous. All this because I simply asked where the bathroom was… I have been a patient since 2002. Dr. Paloyan and his staff are top-notch! I have never had a negative experience with his office. As a surgeon, he is wonderful. You can hardly see the scar where my thyroid was removed. Let me begin by saying I have never written a review for any doctor, and I have been to many in my lifetime. I began seeing Dr. Paloyan in 1976, when I was 20 years old. Here I am, 40 years later, writing to inform potential patients that he is simply the best of the best. Knowledgeable, compassionate, thoughtful, caring - he is an utterly brilliant doctor who has my total respect and admiration. I have gone to Dr. Paloyan since I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism since I was 16 years old. Now being 26, I drove 3 hours to go see him, as a I always do at my yearly checkup. This will be the LAST time I am going to see him. To feel rushed is an understatement. He quickly wanted to up my prescription (which is not what I wanted), he didn't spend time on my questions that I had regarding my ultra sound and lately he told me that I probably need to see a doctor closer to where I live. I recently moved to Indiana and have gone to see him since I was 16 and didn't mind the drive, I wanted the to see the ""best doctor"" that I could. I pay all of my bills and show up to the appointments on time, so this is besides me. Now trying to get my records from this office has been a mess to say the least. I've been calling over a month to try and get MY records so I can see a doctor that wants to help their patients. He told at my last appointment that I need a needle biopsy and basically ""to go find a new doctor "". Read no more comments; he's horrible. He's not up with the new medical trends and he honestly wants to get you in and out. Save yourself a trip and find a different doctor. I have been seeing Dr. Paloyan for about 5 years. He was the ONLY doctor who really listened to my symptoms, ran the PROPER tests to get me an accurate diagnosis. I was so incredibly relieved to finally have found a doctor that didn't pass me off and tell me there was nothing wrong with me. Dr. Paloyan has monitored me through two pregnancies to make sure my thyroid levels stayed in-tact for the health of me and my babies. He did regular blood tests until my levels evened out and stayed consistent. He monitors my thyroid, nodules and bone density. He EXPLAINS your labs and results to you so that you can understand. I have never had an issue with any of his staff and the ultrasound tech is wonderful as well! I feel so lucky to have found this doctor & finally began to feel taken care of and well again! When I saw Dr. Paloyan he told me that he did not need to see the test results and diagnosed me as hypothyroid. After being put on medication, I called him with increased fatigue and weight gain of 15 lbs in less than 3 months. He said I was getting older and he heard this from women - I was only 48. He changed my medication four times,increasing dosage over the phone. On my appointment, my resting heart rate soared to 110 and the nodules multiplied. His staff was frantic when they checked my blood pressure and heart rate and he told me I wouldn't last much longer like this. We parted ways but he made a permanent mark on my life. Unfortunately I cannot undo what happened but I warn anyone to trust this doctor other than his being a surgeon. His license should be revoked, and his daughter specialized in sleep apnea at his office - a common side effect. I hope you consider a professional and walk away from his treatments. Dr. Paloyan has handled my hypothyrodism for the past 5 years and he is a fantastic doctor. He is caring, he listens, he explains everything in detail until you understand it. He regularly does bone density tests and biopsies of my thyroid which has some cysts. I absolutely love him. The woman that runs the front desk, however, is horrible. She is rude, abrupt, nasty. I'm sure she has worked there a long time but she has certainly lost the love of her job. It is time for her to go. She is extremely rude on the phone as well. Went to 3 docs. All said my TSH was fine. Then, one thyroid dr, who gave me synthroid. still felt like crap. Dr. Paloyan told me synthroid is not good, gave me new med, higher dose, another med for energy. and, ultra sound tests, watches my bone density/free samples every visit, nice ladies at the desk too. Dr. Payloyan is a wonderful doctor - they don't make them like this anymore. I went there with a slightly abnormal TSH reading but told him I wanted to get pregnant soon and he immediately gave me a plan of attack. I had no idea your thyroid could cause infertility. I sit here almost 6 months pregnant (got pregnant naturally) and he continues to keep my thyroid in check. Wonderful bedside manner. Great staff. It takes awhile to get an appointment but it's only because he's in such high demand. Worth the wait. Having a long history of thyroid issues and being a patient of a fair number of endocrinologist, I can certainly say that I had the opportunity to meet a unique Doctor. He is a professional with extensive and proven knowledge based on a great experience and long years of practice, brilliant approach to a patient's problem, very good explanations of all details, and moreover, wonderful ability to present and discuss the complexity of the thyroid and its connection to so many different processes and functions in our bodies. No other doctor has given me a better overview and in-depth explanation of my problem (hypothyroidism and thyroid nodule, in addition severe PMS ~PMDD, etc). There is a very strong and important relationship between thyroid, hormonal balance and fluctuations, bone density, heart rate and many others. He was the first to discuss my lab results with me in such detail. Dr. Paloyan is not only an expert in his field but also person with a wonderful heart! Thank you. I have been seeing Dr. Paloyan since 2003. The staff is friendly, caring, and always punctual. The doctor makes you feel important and really listens. Excellent care, I feel so much better since seeing him. Great doctor. I am a new patient to Dr. Paloyan and was very happy with him. He spent time with me and listened along with going through my labs. I finally feel like I'm getting proper treatment for my thyroid issues! I saw two doctors prior to Dr. Paloyan who looked only at TSH and pronounced me ""normal"" and sent me home, even with the awful symptoms I had. I have a needle biopsy scheduled and a follow-up appt to re-check my labs. I did wait 3 weeks for an appt, but that's not too concerning given that I've heard of other doctors with wait lists of 6-9 months. All in all, I'm super happy with Dr. Paloyan and highly recommend him. I love Dr. Paloyan!! He has been around for a long time and knows his stuff! He takes very good care of me! We should all consider ourselves very lucky to have him! His whole staff id wonderful. I'm going to just be crushed when he decides to retire!!! Dr. Paloyan is a wonderful doctor and knows what he is doing with out a doubt. I was very impressed the skill and thoroughness of this doctor. Highly recommend him. Dr Paloyan is the most caring Doctor I have ever met. He is so good at diagnosing the problem right away. You feel so safe knowing he is taking care of you. I will concur with other positive comments. Dr. Paloyan is top notch and very thorough with fine tuning numbers and staying on top of nodules with potential growth. He is the definitive compassionate, caring doctor of old. There will never be another doctor like him. He most likely will retire soon due to age and I feel very fortunate he's been my endo doctor for the past 11 years. A privilege to know him. Dr. Paloyan is fabulous, great surgeon, wonderful bedside manner If you have any kind of thyroid issue or suspect you might have one, you couldn't find a better doctor in the area than Dr. Paloyan. A lot of doctors just look at your TSH score. Dr. Paloyan is a lot more thorough by doing a complete thyroid panel and an ultrasound to see what your thyroid actually looks like. By doing this, he catches a lot of thyroid problems that other doctors miss. He also has a wonderful personality and takes the time to explain everything to you. The only downside is that because he is good at what he does, there can be a bit of a wait to get an appointment with him. During my visit I felt that I was treated very well.I would absolutely recommend this doctor to my family and friends.I felt this visit was an amazing success!Overall I would rate this visit :

60,Dr. Eric Christoff,Illinois,physician and surgeon license placed on indefinite probation for a minimum of 18 months and must submit a proof of completion of 25 Continuing Medical Education hours for failure to appropriately document the rationale for prescribing controlled substances to several patients., Male,4.18,"I find Dr Christoff to be rather brusque. He barely has time to spend with the patient and is rather apt to just write a prescription and be done with you. And forget about a telephone call. I was told I would be charged $50 if I wanted to talk to him over the phone and that the only way to communicate with him would be via the internet or to set up an appointment to see him in person. Was admitted to Northwestern hospital after going to the emergency room, Dr. Christoff (my PCP at the time) called me the following day at the hospital to inform me I had a deadly disease (OVER THE PHONE). Told me he had to report some of that info to the health authorities in the State of IL and that was it. Did not perfom a visit as normally doctor's do. No compassion whatsoever. He's the best MD I've ever had. His staff is a bit overworked and stressed out, but he's so knowledgeable he makes me feel like everything's fine, even when I'm sick and feel miserable.","I had to go to the ER for a cut in my hand. Dr. Christoff received an alert and called me personally to make sure I was ok, and to let me know I was up to date on tetnus shots. AMAZING SERVICE from a Dr!! Thank you Dr. Christoff! Dr. Christoff is patient and very caring. Some people have high expectations that a physician will be able to meet their every need. Don't be impossible, people. He's a great doctor! Both myself & my husband have been going to see this doctor for 6 years. He may seem rushed, but in a case like this I just tell him ""I need further clarification"" and he stops and does so. He has always followed up with both of us when we have been released from a hospital stay & even had my husband tranfered to Northwestern from another hospital when he had his second stroke. He is a good doctor and we both are thankful for the care he has continued to provide us I find Dr. Christoff to be amazing in his recall of my illnesses, various tests and prescriptions. He is routinely prompt in returning emails and meeting me for appointments.If he's running late, he always apologizes, although I don't think that being 15 minutes late is excessive.He lets me be involved in all decisions regarding my health, encouraging me to offer my own ideas as to best assist me in getting better. I was concerned that my googling my situation would be offensive, but he took it all in stride. I think this guy walks on water. Surpised this guy doesn't have better reviews. I thought his bedside manner was great. To the point, no bull, answered all of my questions, spent a lot of time with me. He was also punctual. He performed tests on me which would normally be done by a PA or nurse practitioner (e.g., strep) and re-took my temperature as part of the exam. I thought this was great and an example of his thoroughness and attentiveness. Apparently he specializes in gay and lesbian healthcare issues... I am a straight SAHM and felt very at ease with him and felt that he was attentive to all of my personal healthcare concerns. He's now my primary physician based upon this office visit. Dr Christoff is a good doctor in many respects when he suspects somethings he routinely sends me to specialists. What Dr Christoff does not do is listen to patients well. He, at times seems hurried and when he is this way he almost tunes you out and you must go back to see him on a later date to discuss this one or two items only. He seems to have a high staff turnover and once you get to know them they disappear. There are a lot of good things about him and some things things that are a bit disappointing but over all he is a pretty good doctor. He either needs to cut back in number of patients or schedule less appointments. Dr. Christoff has been my physician for about three years now and I am very satisfied with him. Other city doctors had insisted that I needed to see a psychiatrist regularly to get a prescription for medication that has successfully helped me manage a condition for about 15 years without side effects, ignoring the fact that I cannot afford to see a psychiatrist (not to mention that it is not necessary for me, and when I do, they just tell me what a great job I have done managing my condition). Dr. Christoff is actually willing to work with me and my budget concerns so that I have the medicine that helps me. Is he a bit brusque? Yes, but he is also efficient, well-informed, concerned and thorough. I have recommended him highly to a number of people and have always heard positive responses. One of the best I've had in all of the cities I've lived in. I agree that his staff is overworked, but they are still a great compiment to him. Part of Northwestern Memorial Physicans Group practice in Lincoln Park, he's easy to get along with, gay-friendly and not afraid to say ""i dont know, I will refer you"" Good staff, they pretty much keep to the schedule.

63,Dr. Faris F. Abusharif,Illinois,"physician and surgeon license and controlled substance license temporarily suspended for inappropriate controlled substance prescribing to patients of his practice, boundary violations and self-prescribing of controlled substances", Male,3.3,". He is always late to the point where I had to wait two hours to be seen. I took his and his office staff attitude because it is so hard to find a doctor that will give you opiates for pain. Another issue the new office policy that you must come every month at $357 a visit or he won't give you pain meds. Try calling his office to talk to a live person and good luck. You have to leave a message and you are lucky if they call you back. Luckily I finally found another pain clinic I was told at my recent visit it’s no longer pain management. It’s interventionist which mean injection,stimulators,.I was told every patient had their meds cut by 2/3’s that week. Very disappointed. This doctor is routinely late for ALL appts. On June 7th, 2018 I told him he was 1.5 hrs late for our appt to which he replied he was sorry. At that point I told him ALL previous appts were also over 1 hr waits and could we show up an hour late for future appts to which he replied “then find someone else to treat you, I don’t need this” and stormed out of the room, slammed the door and refused to treat my wife. I understand doctors run late on occasion, but this doctor could care less of your time and does this on every visit. I find it incredibly rude when doctors are routinely late, can’t manage their schedules and are inconsiderate of others time. If this doctor can’t manage his own time, how can he be expected to manage someone’s pain. Find a considerate doctor respectful of your time. We intend to file a complaint with the Illinois State Medical Disciplinary Board, IDFPR. I recommend others do the same by Google searching “Illinois IDFPR”. They are located here:

100 West Randolph, 9th Floor | Chicago, IL 60601 or

320 West Washington, 3rd Floor | Springfield, IL 62786 

Or by calling their 888 number to file a phone complaint. This is the third time seeing the dr and is NEVER on time! 2-3 hour wait, when in pain, is not right!!!! My wife was refused service because she was car sick, as we were on our way to Dr Abusharif’s we stopped by Portillo's for a chicken sandwich. As we arrived my wife started to vomit because she was car sick. She fractured her ankle in three places, and was in tremendous pain. As I walked into Doctor Abusharif's office, I asked for a wheel chair because my wife has a temporary cast and the fracture was still causing her much pain. The first thing we did was go straight to the washroom so that she could clean herself up. While I was waiting for her outside the washroom, two of the Doctor's assistants were conversing with the doctor about my wife's condition. They were saying, I am not going to touch her because she vomited. How disrespectful? Yes, DISRESPECTFUL!!! A doctor talking and laughing about a patient, making remarks. As they put us in room, a so-called nurse came in and said that we had to reschedule because my wife was sick. Which they did not even bother to ask, why was she sick? I actually requested to talk to the doctor to talk to him about ETHICS but he refused to come in and see us in the patient room. Five minutes later the Oak Lawn Police showed up, I told them exactly what happened. My wife and I are Marines we served our time in the desert, is this how you treat veterans? At least in the Marine Corps we don't talk about our Marines in a negative way when they are in need of medical help.

Semper Fi. The doctor is good. The receptionist is unprofessional, condescending and makes mistakes. they do not return emergency phone calls. The doctor isn't worth putting up with the grief. Although we were happy with Dr. Abusharif, his staff was beyond unprofessional and unpleasant. My first phone call, I had problems, stating I didn't have current x-rays, hence, I was told he couldn't see me. (Another doctor then took x-rays with no problem so I could see this doctor). It only became more difficult every visit. I was embarrassed and talked down to in front of other patients, not sure if I was even going to see this doctor or an intern (who was also talked down to by the staff) and often left my visits in tears. Having additional serious health problems, I called for 3 months to get some direction with no return call! I addressed staff problems with the doctor (he should know since this is his business). He was responsive and concerned. Unfortunately, the snowballing effect of this toxic staff didn't get better. Being so unhappy in their jobs, they need to leave since this is a fine doctor. Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to talk to him for the staff. The best doctor I've ever seen. I 've seen 5 doctors since my injury and he is the only one that LISTENED to me . He took his time . He was concerned. Unfortunately he is out of network and my insurance does'nt cover the visit. I called to ask him advice on what doctor I should see next. Again he took his time and pointed me in the right direction. he's one of the best physicians i have ever seen. felt no pain after seeing him.","Dr. Faris was always kind and calming. He reassured me that my back injections would be painless and help afterwards. The staff was always up beat and made me laugh. They listened to my concerns and met all my needs. Thank you guys. Ms. Coleman The staff is wonderful and Dr. Abusharif is just amazing. I was so disappointed with my last pain Dr I didn't go in with the highest of expectations, but man did he beat any expectations I've ever had for any Dr. He's so warm, caring, and genuinely wants to help you! He doesn't want to drug you up and send you out. I am just so happy and relieved I've found him. I couldn't recommend him higher to anyone! I have to say the one negative comment he got on here is WAY off. This doc is the ONLY pain doc out of 30 that would even consider seeing me for my condition (Interstitial Cystitis).Dr has been nothing but an AMAZING doctor, very kind, warm and willing to take his time to explain EVERYTHING to you. When I cried bc he said we only had one option to try and help me, he felt SOO bad and that shows he really cares. His staff is awesome and asks how I am doing whenever they see me. Obviously you know you HAVE to be on time to your appt, regardless of traffic. I drive 45 mins to get to the doc and ALWAYS leave an hour early to make sure I am there on time. You KNOW your co-payment and a doc does not and should not take a post dated check...if you don't have the money now, what makes him think you will have it later. Sorry, he is a great doc but does not cater to those that lack common sense. Him and his staff have done wonders for me and I am offended with that negative feedback. Outstanding physician with a great sense of humor. Compassionate. I was nervous to get a spinal injection, yet in so much pain. After consulting with Dr. Abusharif, I felt very comfortable and he was extremely knowledgeable about my spinal condition. I had the procedure and it was so easy to get through and the results were awesome. I would highly recommend Dr. Abusharif Great experience, very handsome and caring physician. I had a consult at Univ. of Chicago and was told there was nothing that could be done for my pain. After one consult Dr. Abusharif suggested a spinal cord stimulaor and eventually surgically implanted the spinal stimulator. I got my life back.

What I do have a problem with is the average wait time being 5 hours everytime. This is very disrespectful to his patients. This is not an issue with him having emergency patient exams. His office schedules patients every 15 minutes. I thought I would beat the wait and make my appointment for the first one of the day. I figured this way I would be in and out. I was wrong my appointment was at 9 am and he did not show up until 11 because he was doing his rounds at the hospitals. This is so crazy I would not recomend this doctor to anyone This Dr is one of the worst Dr's I have ever delt with!My APT was at 4:30 I got to see him at 7pm and he walked out and took care of another PT wile I waited for him. Then he walks in and says I know you, I explaned to him I just moved here from Florida, I was in a 3 car crash and I was the middle car and had been seen by Dr's in Mayo Hospital so I had my Xrays with me and he says to me I see you can not walk? I said yes he said stand up for me, I looked at him and said did you look at the Xray? He said I do not see a problem, a person would have to be blind to see the back was in bad shape. He said to me ok I am going to step out for a Min you read this and your pain will go away, what he gave me was a text that had things on it from the bible, My wife told him we have had about enough of your BS, he looked at her and said well if you do not like the way I am doing things there is the door! She left and he said why are you here? He finely gave me pain meds after 6 hours of BS!","Dr Gilbert spent his Friday evening sitting at the hospital with my father watching a football game before he went home for the evening.

But before I gave up, Dr.Uzun insisted on so many unnecessary procedures and convinced me to do them. And in the end, they send me a $2200 bill which I have no idea why, because they LIED TO ME THEY WERE WITHIN my newtwork and since I am fully insured, I continued my treatment!

The satff is rude, never call you back when they promise and when you follow up, still they can't help with anything you ask! All you hear is we are busy, you have to come down. And the reason for that is of course, they want to charge you another visit. I have had some treatments here which didn't help me to get better at all so I had to go and see other doctors. But before I gave up, Dr.Uzun insisted on so many unnecessary procedures and convinced me to do them. And in the end, they send me a $2200 bill which I have no idea why, because they LIED TO ME THEY WERE WITHIN my newtwork and since I am fully insured, I continued my treatment!

75,Dr. HIRALAL Maheshwari,Illinois,physician and surgeon license placed under a Chaperone Order as a result of being charged with a forcible felony., Male,4.04,"I have had one appointment with Dr. Maheshwari - I felt like rushed when trying to answer the questions and was interrupted several times in my ansers. He prescribed Metformin and also requested I have a thyroid ultrasound done and bloodwork. I received a call regarding my bloodwork test results from the nurse practitioner. I'm still waiting to hear back on my thyroid ultrasound results. I called a week after the ultrsound and was told the doctor would call me back. I have called each week and have explained I have called numerous times looking for these results and have been told each time the doctor will call me back. I don't understand what the problem is. If the results are negative, just tell me. If you're waiting to discuss at my 2month appointment - just tell me that. I have also become nauseous on the medication which the doctor said would happen and to call the office and I have, which again, no return phone call. I have since stopped taking the medication. I'm about ready to cancel my 2month appointment as well and find a new doctor. I cannot rate the doctor's knowledge appropriately at this time because I don't feel like I have received complete care.","I went in November 2014 for my initial appointment. Waited 45 min in the waiting room. Talk to her his assistant for 15 min regarding my health. Dr. Maheshwari came in touched my neck for 30 seconds informs me I need an ultrasound on my neck. Tells me not to worry, that only 3% are cancerous and then leaves the room. Went for ultrasound the next week (in his office). To this day, June 16, 2015, I still do not know my results. I have called numerous times, to no avail. Finally received a bill from office last month for over $200, with a sticker telling me that I cannot make an appointment until it's paid. Like I would. Dr Maheshwari is a very caring Dr. I would definitely recommend him. Dr. Maheshwari is wonderful. He has a fantastic bedside manner and his office staff is helpful and supportive. Dr. Maheshwari is a very professional and caring endocrinologist. Staff also is very professional. He is very knowleageble. I got in within 2 weeks. He has late and early hours to accomodate those who do work during the day. Staff was very nice and pleasant. He spent the time to listen and answer all of my questions. I would recommend him to any of my friends and family. Just because a doctor shakes your hand and pretends to listen does not mean he is a good doctor. He spends 5 minutes with me every time and bills my insurance company $440. He has a wonderful bed side manor, but I think a doctor should have more than that. I always felt rushed in and out. I have progressively gained weight over the years I had been with him and he never really seemed to care. He never did a routine glucose tolerance test 6 weeks after I gave birth, when I had gestational diabetes. I am sick of these doctors who just prescribe drugs without trying to figure out the root of the problem. Some of the staff was very nice. Extremely knowledgeable and interested in his pateints - I did not feel rushed and he spent more than enough time with me. One of the few doctors I have had in over 35 years that did not get angry with my questions or because I wasn't taking perfect care of myself. He has a very good understanding of what it is like trying to deal with diabetes and the struggle that many of us go through. He's a very good guy!means to he is very knowledgable and took his time with us explainig and answerng questions. even after leaving the room he came back because i forgot to ask a few questions, he he was not bothered by that all. we learned so much abouot my husbands condition that we were never aware of he truely is and expert in this field. Very nice office. Courteous staff. Easy to located. He only cares about getting you in & out, so he can go on to the next patient. I always felt rushed. Both myself & husband saw him and we both felt the same way. One time before I was even done speaking he reached out to shake my hand, pulled me up off the chair & put his hand on my back moving me toward the door, We were only with him for no more than 15-20 at the most. Most of the time he saw us both at the same time. I have changed doctors & would not recommend him to anyone. The most important aspect of Dr. Maheshwari is HE LISTENS. He does not make you feel like a fool for asking questions, he spends time answering any and all questions, and will only make medication changes after listening fully to my concerns. He's a FANTASTIC specialist for thyroid conditions. always remembers my daughter, very nice Dr. Answers questions thouroghly. Dr. M is extremely knowledgable. He is at the forefront of medical advances, but conserative at the same time. After 25 years of dealing with diabetes, I finally found a doctor who cared about my well-being. I would recommend him to anyone seeking a better life-style.",1.0,13.0,14,one appointment   felt like rushed trying answer question interrupted several time anser prescribed metformin also requested thyroid ultrasound done bloodwork received call regarding bloodwork test result nurse practitioner im still waiting hear back thyroid ultrasound result called week ultrsound told doctor would call back called week explained called numerous time looking result told time doctor call back dont understand problem result negative tell youre waiting discus 2month appointment tell also become nauseous medication doctor said would happen call office return phone call since stopped taking medication im ready cancel 2month appointment well find new doctor rate doctor knowledge appropriately time dont feel like received complete care,went november 2014 initial appointment waited 45 min waiting room talk assistant 15 min regarding health   came touched neck 30 second informs need ultrasound neck tell worry 3 cancerous leaf room went ultrasound next week office day june 16 2015 still know result called numerous time avail finally received bill office last month 200 sticker telling make appointment paid like would   caring  would definitely recommend   wonderful fantastic bedside manner office staff helpful supportive   professional caring endocrinologist staff also professional knowleageble got within 2 week late early hour accomodate work day staff nice pleasant spent time listen answer question would recommend friend family doctor shake hand pretend listen mean good doctor spends 5 minute every time bill insurance company 440 wonderful bed side manor think doctor always felt rushed progressively gained weight year never really seemed care never routine glucose tolerance test 6 week gave birth gestational diabetes sick doctor prescribe ug without trying figure root problem staff nice extremely knowledgeable interested pateints feel rushed spent enough time one doctor 35 year get angry question wasnt taking perfect care good understanding like trying deal diabetes struggle many u go he good guymeans knowledgable took time u explainig answerng question even leaving room came back forgot ask question bothered learned much abouot husband condition never aware truely expert field nice office courteous staff easy located care getting go next patient always felt rushed husband saw felt way one time even done speaking reached shake hand pulled chair put hand back moving toward door 1520 time saw u time changed doctor would recommend anyone important aspect   listens make feel like fool asking question spends time answering question make medication change listening fully concern he fantastic specialist thyroid condition always remembers daughter nice  answer question thouroghly  extremely knowledgable forefront medical advance conserative time 25 year dealing diabetes finally found doctor cared wellbeing would recommend anyone seeking better lifestyle,0.999999,0.004070742,0.999999,0.001209805,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.715,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,1,1,1,0,0

She possesses a unique combination of medical expertise and human compassion. I can't describe how much that lets me know she's genuinely concerned about helping me. I felt compelled to share my thoughts with the internet community that my experience with her has been wonderful. She is punctual, organized and takes time to discuss conditions in a way that makes sense to me. Each of our meetings is a continuation of the previous and we make progress each and every time.

81,Dr. Ijaz Mahmood,Illinois,physician and surgeon license indefinitely suspended due to healthcare fraud conviction in April 2022., Male,2.69,"This doctor's staff is terrible they are no help at all they have u wait forever. It's a joke. Everyone I come there I'm there for at least four hours and that's just to get a shot. It's crazy, the doctor spends three minutes with u if your lucky, he doesn't listen to what your saying and he has the worst staff I've ever seen, my five year old could do a better job. I call to ask a question they never know the answer and I'm always on the phone for 30 minutes or longer and still never get my question answered. I would not recommend this office or doctor to my worst enemy. I was refered to this doctor by my primary doctor and i first want to say he was not the problem with my horrible experience. ..it was his staff...two days in a row i was left in the iv room while the medicine backex up under my skin causing pain and swelling...this happened to both arms on seperate days....i was told some people would be happy to have only gotten stuck twice and not given any treatment for their mistake. ..the second time ut happened i had to yell for someone to come take out the iv because no one ever came to check on me ...i fibally called the front desk just to get someone back there...this also happened to my grandmother at one of her previous trips to this office....i dont know who to complain to about the negligence but potential patients need to be aware of the potential treatment or lack there of provided by his staff My sister was 28 yrs. old when diagnosed w/ breast cancer. This doctor removed both breasts leaving zig zag scars across my sister's chest with no tissue or nipple left for reconstructive surgury. He also did not offer her the latest and most effective treatment b/c she lived under the poverty line in America and received poor health care. For such a prestigious profession where the sole purpose is to heal and save lives...this man did not seem to be able to look at my sister when speaking with her nor would he speak with her unless a man was present. I am not sure if this is a cultural thing, but this behavior is quite unprofessional. This doctor did not seem to care about my sister as a human being or as his patient. I firmly believe that she lost her life at the young age of 29 b/c of the lack of care, knowledge, and experience of this doctor.","I would love to return to Dr. Mahmood as a patient , but will not until he gets rid of his office Mgr.

Would not consider going elsewhere Dr mahmood has been treating my husband for 2 years for liver cancer stage 4 when we first started with him he knew what our financial situation was we were told don't worry I'll treat you anyway now we are being told you can't come back because you owe me money. We tried to get my husband ctrl scan and were told we could not have it unless we paid 300.00 dollars we draw about 1200 a month my husband will dye with out treatment but all this doctor cares about is money. I hope he knows he will be judged for this. And I hope his office never comes down with cancer. Don't use this doctor there are other doctors that will help you and will care whether you live or die even if you can't pay. The medical board has asked us to file a complaint against this doctor we may do it, if my husband dies I will do a lot more than that.

My ""aches and pains"" were severe enough to keep me awake at night despite HIGH doses of ibuprofin. My ""aches and pains"" were accompanied by swelling and reddening in my left leg.

Just take out the hump i said. He did that but added cutting out the sides of the nose, the tip is gone, and the strip of skin at the bottom of nose that now hangs low. There is nothing i can do about it now except write this. AWFUL. WHy should I have known to say, now listen Dr. only take out the hump like I want and nothing else, I don't care if YOU don't like the rest of my nose, I DID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had botox done by Colton. The office is beautiful and that is the only good thing I can say about my experience. He is insensitive and has the personality of a fish. I will never go back there. I would not recommend him to anyone. There are so many other doctors that truly love the profession and he is certainly not one of them. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Shocking really. Had lift done 10 months ago. Not tight enough, wants to redo the neck and the face. Scared to death since I awoke during the first surgery and he yelled that I was acting like a 2 year old while he was injecting my ears. He said wouldn't be as bad as first time, but hesitant as to whether I should go to another for second opinion or just chance it. He is a good doctor just not bedside manner approved. I had Botox with Dr. Colton on March 15th. I'm a dentist and have been practicing for over 20 years with plenty of injections a day given carefully to my patients. Dr. Colton was told by me, my face is sensitive to injections and to go slowly. He basically dumped roughly 12 injections into my face in a matter of a minute, I felt as if he was angry and aggressive. I felt violated and asked him to stop for a moment to catch my breath. After I asked for an ice packet which they said they did not have. The front desk then brought me in a ziplock baggie with ice cubes...all for $750.00. The Botox did not take. I went to Dr. Colton for Botox 2 times. The first time he was cold and rude, and seemed bothered to answer my questions. Second time, he hurt me with EVERY injection and I've had Botox several times done in Florida, and it NEVER hurt so much! When I asked for more coverage and pd for more, there was NOT better results. When I called, they had NO RECORDS for me to know what areas he injected?? The staff was rude on the phone, hung up on me and could NOT answer my questions?? DO NOT GO TO HIM!!! I almost felt as if because I was questioning him about the last time I was there, and how it seemed like I pd for more, but did not get better results, he purposely hurt me when doing the injections!!!! Seriously don't go to him!!!! I had a lot of complications after my nose surgery caused by this doctor. Instead of taking responsibility for his errors, he blamed me for the problems. He was so rude and got mad when I wanted these problems fixed. He only cares about the money. I am a medical professional. I paid for 1 mL of Restylane and was only injected with 0.4 mL. I'm not sure it was even Restylane. There should have been a sticker on it. I cannot prove it, but I am sure this was a huge scam. I will never return here. I am entitled to my medical records. His charting was horrible. Implants/injectibles should have sticker documentation. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE> I had a nose job done by Dr. Colton and he did not do what was asked of him. It came out horrible and he refused to correct it, said if I paid his full fee again he would do it. He was rude and unprofessional when I went back to him. He even insulted me about the nose job he did. I would NOT recomend him to anyone. He had no compassion for what he did and did not feel it was his responsiblity to repair the rhinoplasty he perfromed. I AM VERY SORRY I USED HIM AS MY PLASTIC SURGEON. I had a nose job with jeffrey colton my nose was slanted to the right and I had a hard time breathing through my nose. Not a very good experience from the consult, so I stopped there. I saw many negative comments and then all these great accolades about this doctor. Very suspicious,and not a coincidence in my opinion. The other comments sound consistent with what I found and heard. dr colton knew I had some complications recovering from his rynoplaty; when I went to office to have a dirt spot cleaned under the skin on my nose(from a pimple) in the cleansing procedure he squeezed my nose so hard with pressure much swelling and torment followed. Dr. Colton was with Lifestyle Face Lift when he preformed the surgery. I had my lower eyelids done and there was a difference between the two. He did do corrective surgery and I was satisfied. However, the mini face lift has not held up as I was told it would. After 4 years I am now searching for another surgeon. There were complications the evening of the Lifestyle Lift and I was not able to get in touch with him after leaving several messages with his service and ended going to the emergency room. he never done anything right,every surgery had to do it twice, last one cheek implants, he coudln't do it , the first and second and even the third time of this surgery ,and he refused to give me a refund back,every time he did it wrong , he ruined my face by keep practicing on me,I allowed him because he took my money and he keep promising me that he will fix my face and its not a big deal,my smile is not accurate , I try my best not to laugh or smile because he crooked it, I do not recommend this doctor , even his assistances are not nice and helpfull,they try to hassle and skam for him as much as they could,and when they realise that the doctor made a surgery mistake , they will try to avoid the patient and try to make the patient responsible for the doctor's mistake , even if he did the surgery wrong and he knows that its not right or its not how it suppose to be , he blame it on the patient,and he always claim that the patient is never happy with his ****ed up work. When complications arose after surgery, I was told the problem would go away with time. It has NOT. After many post op visits, and no resolution, I was finally told to see another plastic surgeon.

After many post op visits, and no resolution, I was finally told to see another plastic surgeon.","The staff, nurses, and Dr. Colton are fantastic. They put me at ease, explained everything in terms I understood, answered all of my questions, and I couldn't be happier with the results! I had a lifestyle lift by Dr. Colton and it looks great but I had some discoloration on my neck from thyroid cancer and Dr. Colton put that under the back of my neck so I would not have to see it at no extra charge. He is a gifted surgeon you can not see an incision anywhere. Thank You Dr.Colton! It has been 10 years and I will go back again. He also did my eyes and everyone tells me that I have beautiful eyes. Five years ago Dr. Colton performed a full face lift for me following my significant weight reduction. He was kind, sensitive, and attentive. Today I continue to look much younger than my years. What I enjoy most is that my look is natural. Even close friends that know I had the lift can not see where the incisions were made. I would definitely return to Dr. Colton and I recommend him to anyone interested in improving their appearance. I recently had a neck and lower face lift from Dr. Colton. I had previously seen Dr. Colton 10 years ago when I had my upper and lower lids done and had a mini-lift. I was so pleased with my results ten years ago, that I decided Dr. Colton was the best physician for this procedure. What I like so much was that my results were so natural; yet the results were much better than I expected. I probably would not have had to see the doctor this time, but I had gained and lost a lot of weight in the intervening ten years and my neck suffered from it. Additionally, Dr. Colton's consultation was thorough and all of the staff went out of their way to address any issues that I had. I highly recommend this skilled surgeon. I had a facelift by Dr. Colton twenty years ago when I was 50, and a mini-lift ten years later. I am 70 now,but you would never know it. It was the best thing I could have done for myself. I had my eyelids lifted as well. I am still working and fit right in with the younger crowd. Because I started at 50 when my neck showed signs of aging but my facial skin was still firm, and then had a touch-up ten years later, my skin has remained smooth with minimal wrinkling. Of course, I don't look like a twenty year old, but looking 50 at my age is not so bad. Dr. Colton is a very caring and excellent surgeon who strives to please his patients. I highly recommend him. Dr. Colton did a rhinoplasty on me. I was very nervous about the entire experience, but i'm so glad i did it. He did a great job and it looks fantastic. My nose looks completely natural yet he defined it beautifully and i love my profile. I highly recommend Dr. Colton. I have had great and lasting results from my mini face lift. However, I am very disappointed with the scars around my ears. I will never be able to wear my hair up or tied back. I did some research on Dr. Colton before I had a facelift and eyelids done by him. When I found out that he had been doing facial plastic surgery for some twenty years and specialized in faces and necks only, I felt confident that he was the surgeon for me. I made the right choice. I had this done in 2000 and still look good. There is a little drooping but I am 9 years older!!! I have friends in Italy who loved the way I looked and came all the way to the States to have him do their surgery. They were more than satisfied. Horrible experience, very unprofessional office with no respect for patients time and unsatisfactory results with large scars and no improvement at all would have sued but waited to long to heal, was told it would improve but it didn't. Very cold doctor. I told him I wanted the smallest size cheek implants. He decided to put in larger size than I requested so I requested him to remove them. Then he had an attitude toward me for the request. Also, he messed up my nose big time. The first time I told him I wanted a soft look profile, but again he decided to made my nose look how he wanted it to look. He made my profile look bold/masculine. Then when I requested revision surgery to make the profile look softer instead of bolder, he had an attitude. His nurse had an attitude as well. She would blame it all on the patient when it was all the doctor's fault. You will need a revision surgery if he does your nose. To save you that ordel, don't go to him. I had my upper and lower eyelids done by Dr. Colton. I am very happy with my results and would recommend Dr. Colton to anyone. I also thought the office staff was very helpful and was there to answer any questions I had. I had Dr. Colton perform my lifestyle lift after I spoke to Dana Mills who works for WOMC radio on the Dick Purtan show. Dana recommended him highly. He did her surgery a few years ago and she was very pleased. Dr. Colton made no false promises to me. He did what he said he would do. I didn't experience any problems and I am very satisfied. I look 10 years younger and it was worth every penny. The staff, nurses, and Dr. Colton are fantastic. They put me at ease, explained everything in terms I understood, answered all of my questions, and I couldn't be happier with the results!

I had a facelift by Dr. Colton twenty years ago when I was 50, and a mini-lift ten years later. I am 70 now,but you would never know it. It was the best thing I could have done for myself. I had my eyelids lifted as well. I am still working and fit right in with the younger crowd. Because I started at 50 when my neck showed signs of aging but my facial skin was still firm, and then had a touch-up ten years later, my skin has remained smooth with minimal wrinkling. Of course, I don't look like a twenty year old, but looking 50 at my age is not so bad. Dr. Colton is a very caring and excellent surgeon who strives to please his patients. I highly recommend him. Dr. Colton did a rhinoplasty on me. I was very nervous about the entire experience, but i'm so glad i did it. He did a great job and it looks fantastic. My nose looks completely natural yet he defined it beautifully and i love my profile. I highly recommend Dr. Colton. I have had great and lasting results from my mini face lift. However, I am very disappointed with the scars around my ears. I will never be able to wear my hair up or tied back. I did some research on Dr. Colton before I had a facelift and eyelids done by him. When I found out that he had been doing facial plastic surgery for some twenty years and specialized in faces and necks only, I felt confident that he was the surgeon for me. I made the right choice. I had this done in 2000 and still look good. There is a little drooping but I am 9 years older!!! I have friends in Italy who loved the way I looked and came all the way to the States to have him do their surgery. They were more than satisfied. Horrible experience, very unprofessional office with no respect for patients time and unsatisfactory results with large scars and no improvement at all would have sued but waited to long to heal, was told it would improve but it didn't. Very cold doctor. I told him I wanted the smallest size cheek implants. He decided to put in larger size than I requested so I requested him to remove them. Then he had an attitude toward me for the request. Also, he messed up my nose big time. The first time I told him I wanted a soft look profile, but again he decided to made my nose look how he wanted it to look. He made my profile look bold/masculine. Then when I requested revision surgery to make the profile look softer instead of bolder, he had an attitude. His nurse had an attitude as well. She would blame it all on the patient when it was all the doctor's fault. You will need a revision surgery if he does your nose. To save you that ordel, don't go to him. I had my upper and lower eyelids done by Dr. Colton. I am very happy with my results and would recommend Dr. Colton to anyone. I also thought the office staff was very helpful and was there to answer any questions I had. I had Dr. Colton perform my lifestyle lift after I spoke to Dana Mills who works for WOMC radio on the Dick Purtan show. Dana recommended him highly. He did her surgery a few years ago and she was very pleased. Dr. Colton made no false promises to me. He did what he said he would do. I didn't experience any problems and I am very satisfied. I look 10 years younger and it was worth every penny.",30.0,24.0,28,uncaring office manager provided followup concern problem result surgical procedure asked rhinoplasty take hump said added cutting

Giroux,Illinois,physician and surgeon license suspended for failure to file and/or pay Illinois state income taxes., Male,3.83,Not practicing in Chicago area anymore - if you are looking for your medical records they are housed with Dr Aurora in Orland Park. Phone # 815-717-8960.,"This doctor kept telling me my son had tonsillitis when in fact he had a double ear infection. This happened numerous times. I would take him one day (not easy to get an appointment for a sick kid you wait until a nurse calls and decides if you can have an appointment and you might wait all day for that call). Then I would have to take him back the next day and low and behold he had a double ear infection. After this happened several times in a matter of two months we went running from that office and found a much better doctor who knew what an ear infection looked like before it ballooned into 2 ear infections. He wasn't very willing to give up my kid's medical records either. The wait time is awful. Once I could hear him talking on the phone outside the door that was very obviously a personal call. He has no respect for other people's time. Oh and if you have a baby with reflux forget getting any help. This same son projectile vomitted at 2 weeks old and he did nothing to help him. Dr. Giroux is amazing! He was my doctor was i was younger, and is now my sons doctor. He still remember all my symptoms from me growing up. He will definetly put your child to ease with his kindness. The only down side to this office is the waiting time. I always show 30-45 minutes before my appt. time just to get out in time. I would definetly recomend this doctor! :) He has always been very friendly and approachable, BUT the wait time is horrible. I constantly schedule the first appointment of the day and have on numerous occasion had to wait over 40 minutes because others have walked in a few minutes before my appt., without one and they saw them ahead of us. I have addressed this with the office staff and nothing seems to be done. I will continue to use Dr. John because my children are at ease with him and he apears to be very good with kids and enjoys his job, especially since the waiting room is always busy. But he needs to address the issue if you make an appt. all appt come first and walk-in wait till the end of the day, hence the meaning APPOINTMENT. He was my pediatrician for many years and was excellent. He knows how to put kids at ease. He even still remembers me and my quirks despite not having been my physician once I went off to college. I definitely recommend him. Dr.John is the best doctor my kids ever had.... They love him.Keep up the good work doc. Dr. John was the first doctor that really listened to us, and didn't discount what we had to say! He helped us to overcome our daughter's BM problems, after years of asking for help! We LOVE him! He does a great job with my child who has special needs. He lets the kids call him Doctor John, which tells you that he does not have a cocky attitude. Dr. John is terrific with children.

I started seeing him years ( I mean 14 years perhaps?) No one could diagnose me. He listened and also to those that think he OVER PRESCRIBES he is the doctor that actually reffered me to another one to have thorough testing done. ( and I mean weeks worth of testing to see if I had ADHD. ) I assumed at that time it was the law, he cared enough about me and his patients he never just prescribed stimulents until HE KNEW i was in fact tested and ( in a controlled and non controlled). ( the testing that you cannot trick doctors.) for true ADHD patients. NOT one time did he overprescribe me. In fact he saved me, my mind raced I had so much anxiety. School was so difficult, Its like a million things at one time in my head. And HE figured it out. ( do you people have any idea how MANY other doctors literally drugged me! Ambian, xanax, paxil. Ect. Ativan. Not ONCE did dr. Gamze do that at all. He treated my diagnoses. And ( for those people who think that he is a over prescriber or whatever:

TRY being a psychiatrist!! The truth is the mind is very complex! NO one knows truly. People coupd take A

Medication and have the adverse reaction. ESP when it comes

To dealing with dr gamze who specializes in ADHD. MEDICAID pays for it 3 days early! So NO i cannot begin to tell you how many friends i lost after they were drugged

With antidepressents ect. ( they killed themselves) to much seratonin) SO NO NARCOTICS is not whats killing people! Its the drugs that fly under the radar!! And PHARMACISTS are NOT DOCTORS! All this because of some dumb ass pharmacist! Props! you tried to tarnish his good name: however:

YOU WILL NEVER BRING HIM DOWN! He is above that. And has an amazing family. And is an amaZing persom who had to be put through HELL due to these allegations .. why him?! If YOUR kid is taking medications: - MANAGE THEM! 

Love Dr GAMZE

-. S LEONE I am concerned that Dr. Gamze maybe have overprescribed psychiatric drugs to my friends and family, and concerned that he has been disciplined by the State of Illinois Dept of Professional Regulation September of 2015...his licenses being suspended. www.idfpr.com Johnathan Gamze, is an extremely charming, highly educated, knowledgable & experienced Chief of medical doctors whom is also, a hell of a Snappy dresser! His dinner jacket, which appeared to be something he'd borrowed from a 1976 Burt Reynolds movie~a complete ensemble with a poofy, brown afgan was spectacular. & he not only, continuously engaged my every question, with astute expertise?? HE LISTENED TO WHAT I HAD TO SAY, COMPASSIONATELY & responsively!& mademoiselle, you might think about bringing your infant to a PSYCHIATRIST: beforehand, rather than coming on here to criticise a man whose job it is to enlist somatic therapies(pills), as being dense.... Why did you take a 3 year old toddler to an abnormal psychiatrist, in the first place?; jesus jones. I took my son there for a few appointments before I realized that ""Dr."" Gamze was worthless. My son had repeatedly been diagnosed as ADHD, ADD, depressed, and anxious and various medicines had been tried. After a few visits, Gamze said, ""He doesn't even look depressed to me."" My son and I got up and walked out. Someone please tell me what ""depressed"" looks like! Apparently, Gamze knows. I have had lifelong chronic depression, yet very few people in public would have ever known. I could usually mask it pretty well. Even depressed people know how to put on a good face.","Dr. Gamze is very compassionate. He honestly does care about his patients. He has returned any messages that I have ever left for him. As for over dosing- No way. You are always started on the lowest dose of a medication and only gradually allowed to up any medication. Who knows the patient better - the doctor who went to medical school and has actually evaluated and seen the patient and has years of experience with treating mental illness or a pharmacist who knows nothing about the patient or the patient’s life and probably has never even seen or spoken to the patient except the occasional hi and do you have any questions?

Dr Gamze will also work with your therapist if you give him your permission to speak to them. What some people might not understand is that psychiatrists are specialists in prescribing psychiatric medications. They went through all the additional schooling so of course it’s going to cost more than seeing a regular therapist. Anytime you go to any specialist it does! Dr Gamze has helped me for 20 years now. He is the most polite , non threatening person I have ever met. Years later my daughter also ended up going to him for ADHD and before any treatment or diagnosis she was sent to a neurologist for extensive testing.

My daughter is very shy and she even feels comfortable talking to Dr Gamze. I am grateful that a friend recommended Dr. Gamze to me. He is not only professional and knowledgeable, but truly a kind human being. He is always available to me and answers any voicemails that I leave for him. My personal experience continues to be very positive. HELLO people! Lol dr gamze wasbt suspended in 1989!! So RELAX PEOPlE Dr. GAMZE is an amazing doctor, he doesnt over prescribe!! He is the rare doctor that you come across that listens thst actually helps you( for those who have said he OVRF prescribed - let me clear for you? It seems these anyone wants to point a finger! However maybe T was you who couldn't ja dle the medication or you lied to him jusr to get the drugs ? In my 31 years and hes o am a doctor most people tHat say he over prescribes medication, maybe it's lol.thwt fact that he I the what again? The specialist the PSYCHIatRist!! You are not nor I am, and I have sent him for 13 years he never ever once over prescribes me he was godsenthe actually helped me so much, I owe him everything ( I do have adhd and anxiety but however I don seee him over prescribing plus - wbkemcr you are , did you it filled? I bet you did 

Don't blame gold ewtd person , doctor because yiur an addict and welcome. to word! Lol ( all doctors over presceibe they do what they think will help if he did he felt that you do j fact need the medication ? Maybe it wyou. Don't disrespect dr gamze becuew most mentally ill patients always thought k ther over dosed! BUT yoir an adult! Tell HIMz not the world you look sad. Dr Jonathan Gamze was an amazing doctor who cared. Has successfully helped me with anxiety and depression.. Very caring doctor who will go above and beyond to help you. Always returns my phone calls and very knowledgeable. One of the best doctors I have ever met. We had an overall excellent experience with Dr. Gamze. He is kind and attentive, and was able to help us with our middle-schooler who suffers from OCD and Tourette's. We were also told we would have a full hour session for $300 by the receptionist and that was not the case. It was 45 minutes at most and we felt as though we were rushed out. He knew his stuff, though, and did not push meds. The nicest, kindest and most understanding doctor ever. I went to him after having a heroin overdose. So I needed help and he prescribed me the medicine that helped me get a new job, make my me not crave illegal drugs, and feel more comfortable and confident as a person. I recommend this doctor to everybody. He helped me with controlling addiction, adhd, and probably saved my life. He will also not judge you when you ask about a certain medication. He does not treat you like an addict, he treats you like a person. $125 = amt for 15min. Meds update. Takes no insurance. Pay at time of service. I Submit for reimbursement. Good listener. Sincerely interested in me holistically. Very knowledgeable and extremely caring, listens to every detail and is wonderful with my middle school son. Terrible Experience! When I called their office, the nurse assured me of three things: 1.Gamze was an expert at treating trichotillomania (hair pulling) in young children and had treated numerous cases. 2. That he was not a doctor quick to prescribe drugs. 3. That we would have a full evaluation and one hour session with him during the first appointment. Upon meeting with him, we come to find out: 1. By his own words, he is not an expert in trich with children and only treated a couple of cases. 2. He wanted to immediately prescribe anti-depressants to my 3 year old. 3. The session was less than 45 minutes and he would not give me a straight answer when I asked him questions. We were able to get rid of the condition very easily by reading a couple of books and using a behavior redirection and it has never been a problem again! Following Dr. Jonathan Gamze, we would have put our baby on mind altering medication and continued to pay him for additional visits! Check out other docs first! BEST psychiatrist ever. EXTREMELY friendly and positive! Longest I've ever waited at an appointment is 20 minutes (VERY good for a pstchiatrist). DR Gamze is a very kind man. I have used his medical advise and support for over 10 yrs, for me and my family.. Love those 7:30 am appts before I go into work.. Also always has run on time.. no wait.. amazing kind man Dr. Gamze is the most friendly, patient and understanding doctor. He is so helpful and wants to help you feel 100% better Dr. Gamze is a wonderful doctor he really knows what he is talking about and listens to what you have to say to best help you find the right Rx and dosage my mom saw him for years which is how I found out how good he was I would recommend Dr. Gamze to anyone I am glad to see a website like this so the word can be spread about good and bad doctors Best doctor ever. Extremely nice, very knowledgeable, very caring man. If you need a psychiatrist he is probably among the best. I HAVE ALWAYS EXPERIENCED HIM AS VERY KIND, HELPFUL, AND UNDERSTANDING. I WOULD RECOMMEND HIM TO EVERYONE BECAUSE I AM A THERAPIST MYSELF AND I KNOW A GOOD ONE WHEN I FIND HIM OR HER. First of all, Dr. Gamze's staff is always as helpful as they can be. He was the first psychiatrist that i have ever been to, he was recommended by my therapist. When i had my first appointment with him, he was the nicest man I had ever met and has been ever since I have been one of his patients. He has been a great help for me to get better in my mental illness. About 7 months after I first saw him, I decided to get another opinion on what Dr. Gamze diagnosed me with. After meeting with the other psychiatrist I realized what an excellent doctor he was. He will help his patients anyway he can and he always makes me feel the confidence that I will be mentally stable. He is honestly the nicest man I have ever met. Not only that, he really knows what he is talking about. He asks many questions to make sure what he is prescribing you is what you need. I am a teenage patient and he prescribes me medication that I will not need to spend my entire life depending on. I 100% recommend him. Dr.Gamze was extremely respectful of our concerns and asked lots of questions. He worked in conjunction with our daughters professional counselor. That was extremely helpful in discerning the correct medication to prescribe. Dr.Gamze is very prompt in returning voice messages during the week. He is extremely polite and insists that we call him if we have any concerns at all about our daughters progress and treatment. We have worked with two other psychiatrists. Dr.Gamze is by far the most compassionate and knowledgeable. Best doctor ever, he was so great!!! He knew exactly what I needed to feel better, I can't thank him enough. So nice and caring. He is the BEST! Don't waste your time on any other psychiatrist. He works with two of my sons and on me. He believes in low doses of medicine and is extremely competent. If you are looking for personal service, you may want to go elsewhere. The doctor's phone is answered by a lengthy message, not a human being. He takes his time in evaluation (which is fine if your insurance company is paying). Really knows what he's doing. Really conservative with medicine. He won't give you something without making sure it's right for you first and telling you about it. Very friendly. Like the person who commented before me, I agree that Dr. Gamze cuts to the chase and he really knows his stuff when it comes to diagnosing a problem and prescribing medication - which is exactly what a psychiatrist should be skilled at. I personally would go to someone else if I needed therapy of any kind. I only see him for medication management now, but he always seems interested to know how my life is going and he has been really friendly and happy at every visit. I don't feel like he just prescribes me stuff and I'm out, there is a lot of conversation about how I feel on the medicine and whether or not I would like to continue with it. He has always called me back promptly when I left him messages and he always encourages me to call if I'm having any side effects with a medication. I like him... don't know what happened with the others who had bad experiences. Dr. Gamze is top notch! Anyone who says otherwise doesn't really know him. He doesn't accept insurance anymore but you can file a claim and get reimbursed later and it's worth every penny! I came to him after 15 years of mis-managed depression. I was at my lowest EVER and he helped save my life. It's been five years and I'm only on one low dose med and I'm doing great. He doesn't specialize in therapy but knows who to refer you to if you want a therapist. He is extremely talented in diagnosing and prescribing and he won't ""over"" diagnose you. If you are looking for a doctor who will cut to the chase, get you the meds you need and not put you through long talks that result in inaccurate diagnoses......go to Dr. Gamze. He won't put you on anything unless you need it. If you want a therapist get a therapist. If you want a highly trained medical doctor who knows psychiatry like the back of his hand....go to Dr. Gamze. I'm a nurse and I trust him with my life. He's the best there is!",4.0,25.0,32,  amazing dotor also amazing person started seeing year mean 14 year perhaps one ould diagnose listened also think presribes dotor atually reffered another one

95,Dr. Kazem Hak,Minnesota,Continuing Education, Male,4.66,"Used to be my favorite doctor and was so sad to leave when insurance changed. However got excited when I could return when received new insurance. However it seems his disposition has changed doesn’t seem as caring or concerned when before he would’ve been. I am thinking it’s because I my hadn’t been more than a year since we change so we were grandfathered in with the current insurance. It almost feels as if were treated more poorly because of our insurance. Things that should be tested like my potassium which is always low, isn’t. Iron levels, isn’t. I am scared to ask questions anymore because he makes you feel dumb. This doctor I highly respected with my health before now I feel I’m being fluffed off and I rarely go unless u absolutely need to.

I used to be very impressed and thought he cared about my health and well being. He has changed in the last couple years and I have caught his staff in more than one fib.

96,Dr. Keith A. Giaquinto,Illinois,chiropractor license suspended for being more than 30 days delinquent in the payment of child support., Male,4.31,"I have been suffering with migraines for 8 years. I would get a headache/migraine about 4-5 times a week. My migraines were so bad that I’ve had to come home from school occasionally because I couldn’t sit through my classes anymore. I’ve also had called off of work occasionally because I need to lay in a quiet, dark room. I started taking some medication 6 months ago, which didn’t not help at all. I knew that stress played a part in my migraines.

I was referred to Dr. Keith by another one of his patients. At the time when I first saw Dr. Keith, I was having migraines every day for the last 30 days. Dr. Keith told me that the primary cause of my migraines was from my emotional stress that I was putting on myself. After the first week of treatment, I didn’t have a migraine that week and had forgotten what is was like to go to school without one. In the last 2 months of treatment with Dr. Keith, I’ve only had 6 mild tension headaches. I haven’t had a migraine since the treatment began and stopped taking my medication after the first visit.

Managing my stress, getting adjusted and taking enzymes has made a positive impact on my life because they help my body to functioning normally. I knew I was out of balance before this treatment, I just didn’t know what to do. 

I would most definitely recommend others to see Dr. Keith. In fact, I already have! It’s unbelievable that he has helped me manage and lower the intensity of my migraines within 3 months after suffering for 8 years. I never thought a day would come where I wasn't suffering from a migraine. I first came to Dr. Giaquinto’s office in July 2014. I strained my left internal thigh muscle back in January 2014. I was working out in my gym doing a leg press exercise when I pulled my groin. On a scale of 1 to 10, it was about an 8 for pain. The pain made it difficult for me to walk up stairs, do any side to side movements and I couldn’t continue to exercise my legs. I went to my medical doctor for the injury and he told me to ice and rest. 6 months after the injury, I still had it and it was not improving at all. 

I met Dr. Keith at a Naperville Area Chamber of Commerce event. After a few networking meetings, I explained my nagging problem to him. His reply was, “I can help you.” Under Dr. Giaquinto’s care, I improved my range of motion, can walk up stairs, go side to side and have resumed working out my legs at the gym, all pain free. He helped me heal my leg in 2 months. Thank you Dr. Giaquinto. I have lived in Aurora for many years looking for a chiropractor I could trust. I went to dr. Giaquinto's office looking for a holistic approach to my problem. I have seen my fair share of doctors and this doctor takes the cake in the worst I have dealt with in a long time. He seemed more concerned about sales then anything else. I went to Dr. Giaquinto for a neck problem and he told me he could cure not only that issue, but every other pain including another medical promblem that I've spent years seeing specialists for (he claimed he could solve it using enzymes). I was offended that without knowing my medical issue he was arrogant enough that he could fix it. Besides that, the neck issue I went in for was made worse by his care. I ended up at an Orthopaedic Surgeon where after an MRI we found out I have a serious disk problem that was exascerbated by the adjustment. Since the adjustment by hand went numb. Needless to say I am very disappointed with his care.","I first came to the office at the end of August and have currently been under Dr. Keith’s care for almost three months. I had struggled with indigestion, constipation, and upset stomach from the beginning of my childhood. It didn’t matter what I ate, I was constantly bloated and uncomfortable. Going into my twenties I began cutting out nearly all food groups trying to diagnose my condition. By the end of the summer 2015 though, I was so sick I began seeking help from a gastro doctor. I was getting slicing pains in my right side, I couldn’t sleep because of the pain, and at times it was even hard to breathe. I thought I had gallstones, because I had most classic symptoms for them. This pain lasted two weeks with no help from the medical doctor. I was frustrated, tired, throwing up, constantly bloated yet couldn’t eat, and all around an unhappy person until I found Dr. Keith. When my condition became severe I couldn’t even leave the house to go to work. I was on bed rest because any slight movements seemed to upset my entire body. Before this though, I was often sluggish and always hungry even after I ate. I was sleeping 10-12 hours a day, and still not feeling rested. I didn’t even realize how much of my life was taken over by my health, because to me I was “healthy” and had in my mind created an idea of what was “normal” was. I have always been under chiropractic care, but often times felt like I had no support outside of seeing them. The adjustment was great, but within time I would feel lousy again. The medical doctor who tried to treat me only recommended blood work and an invasive procedure where they take a piece of your stomach out and see if there is any harmful bacteria in it. His only real recommendation for me was medication to dilute the pain. I received absolutely no results from these visits except lasting frustration when I think about them. My mom began to see Dr. Keith for similar digestion problems. She decided to give him a try after reading an article in the local health magazine. Within a week and a half my body began to function at a rate I didn’t know to be possible. I went through mild detox with some headaches, but this was all expected to get my body back on track. I am energized after 6 hours of sleep and my energy lasts throughout the day. I’m able to eat again which was the biggest relief. I overall feel more aware, focused, and present within my body and life. I work stressful jobs (waitressing and film sets), as well as being in my senior year of college. Because of the enzymes Dr. Keith has prescribed I am able to tackle all these challenges with a positive attitude. I do not get overwhelmed as quickly oreasily anymore, in fact I don't get overwhelmed at all. Being on the enzymes while also under chiropractic care has really changed the course of my life for the better. I understand what healthy is for me, and will never settle for anything less than what I feel now, and what I feel now is amazing. Also as an added bonus I lost a little over ten pounds. I haven’t done much to assist with this weight loss other than taking ownership of my health and taking the steps to get back on track with Dr. Keith’s plan. The enzymes and knowledge I got from Dr Giaquinto really help me. I felt the best I felt in years. My stomach digestion is 10x better then it has been in years and the stretches he tought me have become a daily rutean for me and really helped my body get back on the right track. The knowledge I got was very eye opening to how the body works. If anyone has any kind of stomach and digestive issues or just want to be more educated on how the body works and the natural solutions to soluve problems you are having in your body I would recommend them to see Dr. Giaquinto Dr Giaquinto treated my nausea, fatigue, insomnia, digestive issues and severe esophageal ulcers. With the blood and urinalysis test he determined what enzymes I needed which changed healing progression. Within three months 95% of my ulcers were healed. His adjustments, enzyme therapy, nutritional counseling and recommened stretching exercises helped me recover my health and energy. He was quick to answer my phone calls and emails. I appreciated his encouraging and positive attitude. His caring and concern manner for my health made me feel that I was a special patient. 
Grateful Christine Dr. Giaquinto's knowledge and helpfulness was outstanding. Under his enzyme care and his recommendation of Juice Plus I feel the healthest I have felt in years. THe enzyme's helped heal a foot problem I was having. I was suffering from Achilles tendonitis, and through all his knowledge in a healthy digestive system my Achilles problem has healed. The Juice plus tablets and the Juice Plus complete has given me the proper nutrition my body needs. I work with alot of children and I am able to have a very healhy immune system. These products can be costly but how can you put a price on your own health. I feel very fortunate to be a patient of Dr. Giaquinto. Thanks for everything. Sue Werth I've experienced alot of support and educational information in my few visits with Dr. Giaquinto--he gave me exercises to do and lots of information about how my body works; and relieved my back and neck pain--for awhile!",4.0,5.0,10,suffering migrine 8 yer would get hedchemigrine 45 time week migrine bd ive come home school occsionlly couldnt sit clss nymore ive lso clled work

Practice, or Condition", Male,5.0,,"Great Doctor, he takes time with you and is concerned about you health. He considers your opinion. Very friendly Listen up EVERYONE! With great admiration, I enthusiastically endorse, Dr. Keri Topouzian! He is brilliant, curious, competent and impressively thorough. He immerses himself in solving clinical, complicated diagnostic problems, until he finds answers! He also has ways of testing deeper into the patients health, even hormone levels and lots more, one of which can leave a patient feeling debilitated and horribly ill until treated. This Dr. is OUTSTANDING! He saved my life and I cannot thank him enough! If you need to travel to see him, DO IT! It will be worth every single penny! We need more Dr.s like Dr. Keri Topouzian!

Saginaw, Michigan I am grateful to have found Dr. Topouzian. He has helped me tremendously and I strongly recommend him to friends and family. Very caring and committed to your health.I have been seeing Dr.Topouzian for over 7 years now. I am a 46 year old chronic Lyme sufferer. We believe I contracted it at the age of 4 while living in Groton CT (10 miles from Lyme CT) I am now a disabled school teacher. To date I have seen 43 Dr's - I would recommend only 1 - Dr Topouzian. His typical office wait is always < 5 min, while his time spent with me is typically > 1 hour. He believes me, I know that doesn't seem like much but after $40,000 of testing over 5 days in hospital , by 8 specialists, I was told to go home. Nothing was wrong, and it could NOT be Lyme because Lyme didn't occur in IL. Dr T clinically diagnosed my Lyme in minutes and later proved it with testing. If your looking for compassion, caring, an open-minded knowledge base and a true human to help facilitate your becoming well, Dr Keri Topouzian is your Dr. - I would give him a 10 out of 5 if possible as his soul is so far beyond the capacity of other Dr's ablity to feel EMPATHY.

Pitiful to treat patients as though their time isn't valuable. I will not be going back. When i was 8 years old i got my tonsils taken out and tubes put in my ears. When we returned for a check up he told me the tubes fell out and i was safe.At the age of ten i had horrible ear aches.Then one day i can't hear and there is only pain. When taken in,we learned that the tube in my right ear never fell out and it punctured my ear drum. I had surgery in which they took skin from my ear to cover the ear drum but it is still semi open and i lost 75% of my hearing in that ear. i wish that was the end but days later i was sleeping and woke up to blood. He didn't do the stitches right so two popped out. he made more and more money from each mistake and never once apologised. i still can't get my ear wet and my hearing is horrible in that ear. in a couple years i plan to get a hearing aid but i'm trying to push it off. please don't let your children go to him. he is reckless and no child deserves that Worst experience EVER! He removed my tonsils on a Saturday...tried reaching him through his after-hour phone center on Sunday because i was in horrible pain...he NEVER called back! I had to get help at ER. Then on Wednesday, called his office to get more pain medicine...they told me he said ""no""...just keep eating popsicles!! I was only 4 days post-op from an adult tonsillectomy...really?? Horrible, Horrible, Horrible experience. No compassion at all. He is a jerk and is only concerned with his money, had no compassion for patients. He is also always at least an hour behind. Worst.

My gut says no and so do I. Trust your instinct!!!! Worst Doctor ever!

Have been under the care of this office for 3 months and in that time, everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Office staff made mistake after mistake. Nurses were rude and argued with me when I called to say that I had a drug interaction that caused a serious illness. I was scared because of how sick I was, and I needed advice. Did not get a call back for an entire week, so I decided on my own to quit the medication this office gave me. Entire staff never lets you get through to the doctor herself. Decided to go elsewhere for care, after waiting 6 mo for a surgery with them. Wanted to tell the doctor about the bad way the staff behaves, but they won’t even let me schedule an appointment. Told me I was no longer a patient when I never told THEM that. I did like the doctor herself, but staff is HORRIBLE. I have called this office many times and emailed the staff for a new patient appointment and have never heard back from them. I am pregnant and in search of an OBGYN as my previous doctor has retired since my last annual. I would not recommend anyone trying to contact this practice. Staff was rude, and my appointments are never on time. If you don't want to wait an hour in the waiting room for a 5-min yearly checkup, I would not go to her if I were you. Furthermore, I did not feel as if I got individualized care. The few times I have gone to see Dr. Teverbaugh, I felt as if she wanted me out of the patient room as quick as possible just so she could get another patient in. Very bad experience. Always late must at least 1 hour past appointmet time the longest wait was 2 hour 45 minutes . She does not know what a appointment is . She thinks people have nothing more to do than wait on her. Had a 8:30 appointment and had to wait 1hour and 30 minutes past my time how can you get that far behind in a half hour after you open. Very poor on punctuality . I was going to see a fertility specialist and when I called to make an appointment with Dr.Couri's after I got pregnant I was told they would not see me at all until I stopped seeing the fertility Dr. My fertility Dr says they have had this problem a lot with them. My Fertility specialist office talked to them and I ended up getting an appt in the long run. I am on short term disability and my Fertility dr put on the forms that they were going to release me on the 8th and my appt with Dr. couris was on the 8th so there would be no gap and I wouldn't loose my STD. Well the same day of my appointment with Dr. Couris they call me and say they can't see me because I still have one more appt with my fertility specialist. So I had to frantically find a Dr to get me in to give me a note for my human resources saying I am still on the same restrictions the fertility Dr had me on so I don't loose my STD. So because of Dr. Couri's office I almost lost my STD.","Am glad to have used them. Very helpful and at your service. words cannot express how i feel. I don't know why it took me so long to write this review but am glad i did. I was just recently diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Dr. Teverbaugh was caring and very understanding and helpful. She took the time to review the results with me and my mother until every one of our questions were ansered and gave us information about things we never would have even thought to ask. I now live 3 hours away but I still keep her for my yearly checkups. I have also seen some of ehr nurse practicioners and every one of them are fabulous!! Great doctor who is very efficient and caring. She took care of my younger son delivery. Very talented and caring, can't praise enough. mine was a high risk prenancy,tverba took lot of care i can never forget her help,she was there always for me when i needed her,my little angel is one year old now.only thing i dont like is everytime u go some new person will be taking care of you. Dr TEverbaugh is amazing, just saw her for the first time and she was very nice and knowledgeable, I would definetely reccomend her to anyone! I had a good experience with Dr. Teverbaugh. She delivered my 2nd baby and also did a D&C after a miscarriage. I have to say that even at the D&C, Dr. T was caring and sesitive and helped me to get through a difficult experience. Her staff on the other hand it subpar. I always felt like I received the run around when on the phone or trying to get a question answered especially after having a complicated miscarriage. I felt like once I got outside the realm of healthy pregnant girl no one in that offive knew what to do. The way that the staff handled my situation caused me to lose confidence in my care and I actually left the practice. But truly it makes me a little sad because I really thought Dr. Teverbaugh was wonderful but just could not handle dealing with the less that wonderful staff the are her ""door keepers""! While you might wait in the waiting room the pay off is good. When you are in the exam room you feel like her only patient. Of all the doctors I have had she has been the best in any specialty. She listens, is helpful and I feel like I can trust her and bring things up with which I might feel uncomfortable. Dr. Teverbaugh and her staff are very caring and helpful. The entire group is wonderful and caring. They really put the patient first.

Confidence;

Negligence", Male,4.03,"My son was born with cerebral palsy after he was told time and time again that I was prone to having large babies. During delivery, he said ""if I would have known he was this big, I would have done a ""C"" Section"" ... REALLY, you were my doctor! Now my son is 21 and uses sticks to walk with. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, spastic displegia, at the age of 2 1/2. Dr. ANDARY NEVER LISTENS TO HIS PATIENTS ... HE KNOWS IT ALL! My son will live with his mistake for the rest of his life. After having open heart surgery and almost dying. I was put on coumadin (blood thinners) for the rest of my life. When my period resumed it was horrible. I went to see dr. Andary. He offered no solution or help of any form and sent me home. Well after bleeding so profusely my hemoglobbin was at 5. I was told to go to the nearest hospital immdiately. My husband took me to southshore. They gave me a blood transfussion the bleeding stopped. Everyone thought maybe it wouldn't happen again. So any months down the road it happened again except worse. I had given dr. Andary àll my paperwork after my surgery for his records. After 3 visits in 1 month he forgot about my surgery and asked me to sign paperwork that stated I saw no specialist, I see a cardiologist, and another about no medication. Humm coumadin? He did nothing! I was passing clots the size of oranges, when I would stand up I would flood the floor with blood. Again, I was told to go to nearest e.r by his answering service. Hospital could not get in touch with him. My hemoglobbin was dropping as I sat in the e.r. well finally we had an oblation schedule to help resolve this. He came to my bed in the prep area before surgery. Told me I continued to go to southshore, I needed a new doctor. Was a completely insensitive donkey.

Great bedside manner & perfect staff. Would highly recommend Dr Andary was my OB for my 4 children. With the first 3, he was great. #4 was a nightmare. My last 2 babies were born quickly, w/o meds. #4 would have been just as smooth, but even though I arrived at an 8 and hadn't been there long, It wasn't fast enough for Dr A. He reached up inside and was trying to stretch me out, while demanding I push. No, I wasn't at a 10 and yes, the baby was fine. The only reason I can think for his rush, was his warm bed. I tried to push at first, but, as most women who have had a baby know, it's pretty futile until you're fully dialated and your BODY, not the dr, tells you to push. He even made a rude comment about having to wait on me. Yes! That's your job! Just when I got my thoughts together enough to tell him to keep his *%# hand out of me, the urge came, and she was born. It's been over a year and I'm still tearing up about it. He was not a good dr when it mattered. Medically knowledgable, yes. But he clearly lacks understanding. Great bed side manner, very knowledgeable, I've been going to Dr. Andary for 12 years and I wouldnt recommend anyone else. Was very compassionate. Listened to my problems and gave me several treatment options. If he did not have an answer for me he would tell me and then would give me the names of people he thought might help. He was very highly regarded by employees that I met while I was at Oakwood Hospital. I have recommended him to all my friends! Dr Andary has been my doctor for 22yrs. He's a very compassionate,warm doctor.I always receive a hug from him. He's never rushed and makes you feel relaxed. I recommend him to any woman looking for a ob/gyn. Dr Andary is one of the best! Absolutely wonderful. Never feel rushed. Takes the time to thoroughly answer any and all questions. Very professional and made me feel comfortable from the very first time I met him. I, like most women, was leary of having a male OB/GYN. Several of the women in my family have been going to him for years and at their request I began seeing him a few years ago. He is absolutely the most wonderful doctor of any kind that I have had. I reccomend him to any woman that askes who my doctor is. I just wish he could practice all areas of medicine. I can't say a bad word about him. I would also like to say that his entire staff is also wonderful, especially at the front desk. Dr Andary was absolutely excellent.

Let me first state that I was going to this doctor for several years, 5 to be exact. Everything always went smoothly while I was there. He always seemed over worked and cold, but he was professional and answered your questions and concerns. Last year I had a procedure done and was left with third degree burns in my vaginal area. He claimed the machine got “stuck”. I was in so much pain I needed to go to the Emergency Room, and they were shocked at the damage done to my skin. It was so bad that they had several burn specialists rounding to my room to look at what was going on. I was humiliated. He didn’t even apologize, he told me I would be okay. The ER ended up giving me medications and antibiotics commonly used for severely burned victims.

106,Dr. Madhu A. Subnani,Illinois,physician and surgeon license temporarily suspended after Michigan Board of Medicine summarily suspended respondent for prescribing controlled substances without legitimate medical purpose and entering false notations in the patient records that would legitimize written prescriptions, Female,3.58,"Horrible stomach still deformed after liposuction! This is the dirtiest , filthiest nastiest office I have ever been to. This dr. Had no recollection of who I was 2 days later and actually gave me examples of myself as another patient. Her office, her instruments and everything there is a huge health risk. She is going to kill someone. Do not risk your life by going into this office. This is not an exaggeration. She is certified in family medicine and yet proclaims to be well versed as a plastic surgeon by doing procedures that she has very little if any training for. The only thing this doctor is concerned about is money. The board of health needs to visit her offices. She has no moral compass or boundaries. It is unfortunate considering she actually was a very nice lady. She needs additional training on the important health risks of contamination. She actually puts these unsterile instruments inside of people. Shame on her. This is a hard time financially for everyone but she needs to get her priorities straight. Never once have I been so disgusted and hurt by the unprofessionalism and lack of concern a doctor has shown after unsuccessfully preform a procedure in my life. Doctor Subnani left me scarred severally after completing a cellulite treatment on my legs, and although I knew going in that my procedure would never show 100 percent results, I never imagined paying almost 10 thousand and seeing no results. After my follow up conceltation with Subnani, she appeared knowledgable of the fact that my procedure did not work and offered to touch up on it in hopes of seeing better results. The thought was reasurring but trying to get a hold of Subnani after that point was impossible and resulted in seeing nothing but hatred from Subnani and getting cussed at by her husband. Do your research before committing to big procedure with a doctor because the end results might just leave you in a worse position than before. I went to the Dr. for weight loss. She is a proponent of the HCG diet plan but I do not feel that she adequately explains the proper protocol for this diet, making it necessary to do your own research. I also feel that she is very overpriced and lacks bedside manner. I would not recommend this practice. Her office and her staff are very unprofessional. The lobby is unkept with dirty floors and wallpaper peeling off the wall. The office has files hanging out and paper work all over the place. The office staff act like they don't know what to do or who to call when a referral is needed and they do not return phone calls. DR. RUSHES THROUGH APPT. WITH OUT LISTENING TO YOU AND GIVES ANTIBIOTICS FOR EVERYTHING. SHE ALSO GAVE MY KIDS FLU SHOTS IN MAY. IS THIS FLU SEASON? SHE IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY AND YOU CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HER. HER STAFF IS UNRELIABLE AND RUDE. DON'T EXPECT A CALL BACK IF YOU LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE DR. THE BILLING DEPARTMENT OR THE OFFICE MANAGER (WHO IS BY THE WAY DR. SUBNANI'S HUSBAND)","This is the best Dr. In the country! She is amazing!! She was very helpful and her office is beautiful! I'm amazed by my liposuction results!! Dr. Subnani is very helpful. She was offering a great deal and was very professional and answered all of my questions. Her office in imlay city is disgusting.. everything and everyone is filthy.. they were always way overbooked you could sit here for an hour easy after your scheduled appointment time.. was new to the area and she was the first Dr I called that was accepting new patients, huge mistake.. DONT GO HERE.. She was amazing! Made me look incredible! Very sweet! Love my results Awful! I have never been to a dirty fiflthy doctors office. The staff was poorly dressed as far as professionalism. Dr subnani did not even a dress my medical concerns appropriately. She said for my back I needed physical therapy,which was true. But what I didn't expect was that their definition of physical therapy was the front desk receptionist hooking me up to a tens unit for an hour!! That will be the last time I ever walk thru those doors!! Do not go here I went to Dr. Subnani for her weight loss program and was very satisfied. I did her program twice while taking a break in between each time. I was able to lose 30 pounds in total, which is more than what I expected. She was willling to meet with me as often as I needed to monitor me. I would certainly recommend her weight loss progrma. I was concerned to go to Dr. Subnani after reading some of the reviews below, but I decided to go forward with getting treatment from her done because she was offering such a good price on her services. Her office was clean and she answered all of my questions clearly. I was happy with my results as I mentioned and have recommended her to my friends. Dr. Subnani is a great doctor and is knowledgeable. I got liposuction done from her and the results were very good- I lost 7 inches off of my stomach. Dr. Madhu Subnani is now working in Chicagoland area but I strongly doubt that she has the license to work in the state of Illinois. I just had a free consultation on November 10, 2013. This doctor ought to be ASHAMED with the poor and shabby conditions of her office but she is not. Dr. Subnani is NOT a board certified plastic surgeon but claims she has done liposuction for 15 years. She also claims that she is offering a special for liposuction charging only a $1000.00 per area. But she had the audacity to charge me $9000.00 for six areas but claims she is giving me a deal. Dr. Subnani made a big mistake thinking I was a fool. And, she also was foolish to think that I would pay $9000.00 to her when she is NOT certified nor probably have the rights to even perform medical procedures in this state. In short, Dr. Subnani appears to be very nice. But most nice people puts a smile on their face and screw you in the end. Please people do your research and be very smart. Dr. Subnani was very helpful and knowledgeable about the issues I discussed with her. I have been going to her for years and have been very pleased with my experiences with her. I am very pleased I had a liposuction and was happy that I choose Dr. Madju Subnani staff was very pleasant. Fantastic Office and Love Dr. Subnani. Extremely personable Dr. This doctor is very good. I have been going to her for over a year now and have been very happy with the way she takes care of me. I came to Dr. Subnani for a Lipo treatment. She was very caring and comforting during the entire procedure, always asking me if I was feeling okay and making sure I wasn't too nervous or wasn't feeling any pain. The day of the procedure I went home and just kind of slept it off and by the next day I was feeling almost 100%. I ended up having really good results and decided to get my arms done as well. Her entire staff is extremely caring and treats you like family. This doctor is extremely nice and helpful. I have been going to her for years and she has taken care of me and my family very well. She cares greatly about your illness and makes sure to tend to whatever it is you need. I can call her at any time and she always answers. It seems like her patients are always her first priority. She is board certified in anti aging so she takes classes that keep her up to date on all kinds of new healing technologies.

TERRIBLE experience with adjustment, timeliness and billing issues like so many others.

She needs to find a new career path, because this isn't it for her. Worst experience ever. Will never go back. Neck problems are much worse after getting ""adjustment"". Billing issues as well. The doctor seemed preoccupied with something and seemed more concerned with her own appearance. She missed most of my appointments. The times I did see her she seamed out of it, and because of that I now have more neck problems then when I first saw her. This business only wants to bill your insurance and get you out in 5 minutes. Bad business. Not personable. Only wants your money. Staff was polite & obviously uncomfortable telling me the doctor was going to be late, appointment had been scheduled for days with Dr. McAndrews & she showed up 45 minutes late smelling of smoke which I feel didn't fit with the basis of her practice. She shuffled me quickly to another doctor in her office but did speak with me briefly before I left assuring me I would see her on my next visit. She never showed to my next appointments so I stopped going. Ended up with major billing issue also, billing girl was always ""out of the office"" what I found out through my insurance company was that I had services submitted on days I didn't even have an appointment scheduled and for more visits then I ever made. Terrible business woman. Scheduled an appointment a week in advance - waited over an hour and then Dr. Mary just decided not to show up at all. He staff seemed confused and unsure of how to do anything or where the doctor even was. Would never recommend her to anyone! Rude & inconsiderate. Found another GREAT chiropractor in the area though!","I have been a patient of Dr mc Andrews for 7 years and she has helped me with multiple issues. I cannot stress enough how satisfying it is to find a chiropractor that is so knowledgeable in her profession. 

Her entire staff makes you feel welcomed and at home but above all else extremely efficient.

I cannot recommend her enough. If you like direct answers and a doctor that gathers all information before she suggests a remedy, then you've found your doctor. I've been to the Dr. McAndrew’s office multiple times for a variety of problems (shoulder, back pain and thumb) and have experienced significant pain relief with each visit. I love that the acupuncture is electric rather than with the old fashioned needles.

115,Dr. Meena A Ramani,Michigan,Negligence, Female,2.47,"Dr. Ramani and her nurse practitioner tried to force the flu shot and HPV on my child by showing us clips of dying children and telling us we needed to ""fear the Russians"" she also told us if we did not get the flu shot she would refuse to give my child antibiotics that she said she would already give her. She had been running a fever, sore throat, and a ear ache... We'd been battling a week and she'd been sent home from school. The next day we were at urgent care and she thankfully was taken care of since her symptoms were worsening. The antibiotics immediately made a difference. Shame on her!!!!! I have told the office what she did and they insisted I still come there. WHAT! She's a fear mongerer, all I wanted was my daughter healthy not a fight over beliefs. Completely bad timing. Don't strong arm this mother. This Dr is rude and unprofessional. She goes against what u say is OK for your children. The dog she has in the office is mean. Office not Safe for kids. Potential dangers for kids to get hurt on include the dog the toy chest that slams closed. She also dosent calibrate her blood level readers correctly. Had me freaking out for a while thinking my baby had lead point but he doesn't. Also keeps trying to push speech therapy on my two year old right when he turned two just because he couldn't recite what she was saying to him. Issue is she has a thick accent and I'm 200% sure my baby couldn't understand her My daughter has been going to Dr Ramani for almost two and complaining of stomach pain. We were told over and over that it's acid reflux and constipation. For the past two weeks every time my daughter ate something, she got sick! I finally told them I wanted blood work. I waited for the results on my chart and it was showing my daughter had inflammation in her body. I called Dr Ramani right away and she said she forgot to check the results and would call me back. Two hours later she called and said we could wait for someone to call back or go to the emergency room for further testing. I decided to go the emergency room and when additional testing was performed, the emergency doctor, the surgeon and I thought my daughter should be admitted for additional testing. Dr Ramani fought us for 7 hours and then finally agreed to let her stay when we brought in a GI doctor. Late that night, I found out that my daughter has been suffering from Crohn's disease. Dr Ramani came in the next day and said we should go home! Dr Ramani said there was a few of $1000 every night of my daughters stay and if I had to pay it, I wouldn't keep her there. Well let me tell you something Ramani, I do t care how much it costs or how hard I have to fight, my child comes first! Once again, the nurses and I were fighting for my daughter! On the third day my daughter had surgery and stated IV medication. She's home now and on oral medication. She has an autoimmune disease and has to have infusions 5 times in the next 8 weeks and then every 8 weeks for the rest of her life! I would never recommend this so called doctors office to anyone! Not to mention Ramani keeps her dog at the office and it tries to bite my 15 year old son for no reason! If you're reading this Ramani, you are ring in every way for the way you treated my family and I would never put a child's life in your hands! Dr. Ramani does not care about her patients. She is extremely rude. Refused to treat my daughter for scabies. And called me out when I seeked treatment else where. Told me that she was her Dr. And that she she be the only one to diagnose and treat her. Funny part is she can't even pronuce my daughters name, and she has been her patient for over 5 years! After her rude comments I immediately got a new Dr. For my daughter. Never will I be disrespect for doing the right thing for my children. Please beware of her don't make the same mistake as I did, for making her my daughters pediatrician! I've been going to this doctor for a long time. I keep begging my mom for a new one. She always tells me I'm overweight and rushes me out everytime I'm there. She makes me scared to go there because it seems like she doesn't know what she's talking about. I've been going to dr ramani sence I was a litte girl now my kids are seeing her. Wouldn't go anywhere else Very rude doctor!! She asked me why I had a c-section with my daughter and I told her because my first chid was. She said that is no reason and that a c-section is the chicken way out!! Looking for a new doctor ASAP!! Staff is always, always very rude. The nurse practioner should have taken a class on common etiquette or went into a field that didn't require working with other people, let alone patients who are children. Get rid of the dog in the office. How unprofessional is that? The office looks dirty all the time. I didn't even get to see the dr I seen her nurse pract. and she was very rude and unprofessional . She was not kid friendly and she was very short we us. We had a appt at 400 didn't get in the bk until 435 or so. The staff was rude not friendly. But the nurse pract. was the worst I ever seen, she was unconcerned and rushed us out. I will never take my children to this dr again. Also they did nothing for my child he left the office with a 102 temp.. called her on the weekend cause that was her policy when going to er and she told me to quit calling her and go to er. got a second opinion on my three yr old who had a rash for over a yr and that dr found mrsa on my baby from being on amoxicillion to long he was resistant. She told me the other dr was not well educated and didnt know what he was talking about. Very gruff and somewhat rude! Embarassed my son by telling him he was overweight and misdiagnosed him a couple of times. Didn't bother to leave the room while he was changing into a gown. Once she had a resident and didn't speak to me directly ONCE! She just left the room and left us standing there! Also has lots of patients with allergies and has a dog in the office! Very unprofessional. I did not get a great feeling from this doctor, she did not explain anything she was doing while examining my son (5yrs old). Rather gruff and unfriendly. Dr. Ramani and her nurse practitioner tried to force the flu shot and HPV on my child by showing us clips of dying children and telling us we needed to ""fear the Russians"" she also told us if we did not get the flu shot she would refuse to give my child antibiotics that she said she would already give her. She had been running a fever, sore throat, and a ear ache... We'd been battling a week and she'd been sent home from school. The next day we were at urgent care and she thankfully was taken care of since her symptoms were worsening. The antibiotics immediately made a difference. Shame on her!!!!! I have told the office what she did and they insisted I still come there. WHAT! She's a fear mongerer, all I wanted was my daughter healthy not a fight over beliefs. Completely bad timing. Don't strong arm this mother. This Dr is rude and unprofessional. She goes against what u say is OK for your children. The dog she has in the office is mean. Office not Safe for kids. Potential dangers for kids to get hurt on include the dog the toy chest that slams closed. She also dosent calibrate her blood level readers correctly. Had me freaking out for a while thinking my baby had lead point but he doesn't. Also keeps trying to push speech therapy on my two year old right when he turned two just because he couldn't recite what she was saying to him. Issue is she has a thick accent and I'm 200% sure my baby couldn't understand her My daughter has been going to Dr Ramani for almost two and complaining of stomach pain. We were told over and over that it's acid reflux and constipation. For the past two weeks every time my daughter ate something, she got sick! I finally told them I wanted blood work. I waited for the results on my chart and it was showing my daughter had inflammation in her body. I called Dr Ramani right away and she said she forgot to check the results and would call me back. Two hours later she called and said we could wait for someone to call back or go to the emergency room for further testing. I decided to go the emergency room and when additional testing was performed, the emergency doctor, the surgeon and I thought my daughter should be admitted for additional testing. Dr Ramani fought us for 7 hours and then finally agreed to let her stay when we brought in a GI doctor. Late that night, I found out that my daughter has been suffering from Crohn's disease. Dr Ramani came in the next day and said we should go home! Dr Ramani said there was a few of $1000 every night of my daughters stay and if I had to pay it, I wouldn't keep her there. Well let me tell you something Ramani, I do t care how much it costs or how hard I have to fight, my child comes first! Once again, the nurses and I were fighting for my daughter! On the third day my daughter had surgery and stated IV medication. She's home now and on oral medication. She has an autoimmune disease and has to have infusions 5 times in the next 8 weeks and then every 8 weeks for the rest of her life! I would never recommend this so called doctors office to anyone! Not to mention Ramani keeps her dog at the office and it tries to bite my 15 year old son for no reason! If you're reading this Ramani, you are ring in every way for the way you treated my family and I would never put a child's life in your hands! Dr. Ramani does not care about her patients. She is extremely rude. Refused to treat my daughter for scabies. And called me out when I seeked treatment else where. Told me that she was her Dr. And that she she be the only one to diagnose and treat her. Funny part is she can't even pronuce my daughters name, and she has been her patient for over 5 years! After her rude comments I immediately got a new Dr. For my daughter. Never will I be disrespect for doing the right thing for my children. Please beware of her don't make the same mistake as I did, for making her my daughters pediatrician! I've been going to this doctor for a long time. I keep begging my mom for a new one. She always tells me I'm overweight and rushes me out everytime I'm there. She makes me scared to go there because it seems like she doesn't know what she's talking about. I've been going to dr ramani sence I was a litte girl now my kids are seeing her. Wouldn't go anywhere else Very rude doctor!! She asked me why I had a c-section with my daughter and I told her because my first chid was. She said that is no reason and that a c-section is the chicken way out!! Looking for a new doctor ASAP!!

Tried PT, chiropractic and acupuncture. Dr. Rock helped me greatly with pain management when nobody else could.","Highly recommended and has innovative ways to help people with pain. My name is Maria Cruz, I highly recommend Dr. Rock and his Staff. The office will treat you with the best manners as possible. He stands out as one of the best doctors I have seen, and trust me I have tried with many Physicians looking for the best understanding of my condition. He will treat you with dignity, and always carries a smile, gives you hope, and will treat you with a treatment package that makes senses and if you follow his orders he will continue through with a plan. I am very impressed with Dr. Rock ability to handle my pain situation. I did move to Chicago to follow up with him because he is one of the few honest doctors I had ever seen. He is way positive and keeps me positive every time we speak. May the Lord bless him and keep him working his very busy schedule. Took over a week for them to return my call. Of the 6 times I called, they never answered the phone, not once. After finally returning my call, they made ME call my insurance to tell me if HE accepted my insurance! They were too busy not answering the phone to see what insurance they accept... After doing their leg work, I called back, no answer. Left another message. After an hour, they call back, same woman, responding to my message, had no clue who I was or why I was calling! She then informed me they couldn't get me in for another 3 weeks! After waiting a week to set the appointment, they want me to wait another 3 weeks to get in! Do your self a favor, skip this ""doctor"". He, most certainly, does not rock. Absolutely wonderful, is straight forward and tells you how it is.

When you ask them a question they look up at you like your bothering them. There was one nurse that actually explained procedures and was nice. The Dr. listens but doesn't seem to care on what your telling him. I think that he is very unprofessional! If you want a doctor that is out to get your money, pick him!! I like him very much also for his warmth, knowledge and willingness to answer questions. I'm fairly new to his practice, but the staff couldn't be nicer also.","I have been cared for by Dr Hall for many years and have never been disappointed. When needed he recommends excellent specialists. He is thorough with both his diagnosis and recommended treatment. Dr Hall is s great doctor. He takes time to listen to me and helps me. I would highly recommend him. Dr. Hall is a compassionate doctor with a great bedside manner. He seems to really care about his patients. He always takes time to listen. My concerns are three. First, his staff filed my bloodwork results without notifying me that my blood sugar was at 280. I didn't learn about the high sugar until my next physical, 15 months later, when he said something about me testing at 284 - up 4 points from the year before. I get a physical every 12-15 months. How long had my sugar been that high? It didn't go from normal to 280 in a year! This negligence has had serious health consequences for me. Second, he never referred to to a dietician. Third, he has no after-hours answering service. When I had an early morning emergency there was no way to reach Dr. Hall or even to leave him a message. I was completely on my own. It is with sadness that I am looking for another doctor. Dr. Hall is great, and even better in his new facility. His staff is very helpful, fast, never a long wait. He is very compassionate and easy to talk too. I have recommended him to several family members and they all agree. He's great Very good staff and compassionate doctor. I have only seen him a couple times now, but I am more comfortable with him than any other physician I've seen in the past. I have been seeing Dr. Hall for about 17 years now and I have always been happy with his service. Every specialist he has recommened to me I have also been happy with. I will continue to see Dr. Hall until he retires. Dr. Hall was recommended to me by a co-worker and I have recommeneded him to 7 friends/family. Dr. M. Hall is an excellent doctor. I have been a patient of his for approximately 10 years and I have never had a better physician. You can ask him about any issue and he explains things in an understandable way.

Will never take my children there again!!!! I can only imagine why he goes through staff every other week. My family loves Dr. Sackman! He is great with our kids and gives us free samples of meds our insurance doesn't cover. He also lets me listen to lung sounds and look into my kids' ears and throats, so I can see how bad illnesses/infections are. Some of his staff members can be a little on the rude side, but he is always pleasant to us! He also likes to be paged if we bring our kids to the ER, so he can come and see them himself, instead of an unfamiliar doctor. We are so grateful for a doctor like him in Hillsdale County! excellent accurate fast honest lovely person and care about his patients Very smart quick loves his patients take all inssurances hard worker friendly helps everybody My family LOVES Dr. Sackman's office.

123,Dr. Monique Brotman,Illinois,physician and surgeon license indefinitely suspended due to vendor fraud conviction in November 2022., Female,2.76,"It was so bad I wanted to give Dr Brotman’e a zero but that’s not possible so I give her a one. She’s extremely rude and unprofessional. In my experience with Dr. Brotman, whom I was referred to by my midwives, she was incredibly rude, had no tact/warmth in her bedside manor and made me feel like she had no time for me. I was so disappointed and appalled, as a physician who took an oath to fulfill, to the best of their ability and judgment, the covenant of warmth, sympathy, and understanding, none of which I have ever experienced with Dr. Brotman. Not only was her bedside manor so poor, it also made me question her level of care/concern for her patients. I plan to send a letter to all hospitals she’s affiliated with as well as West Suburban Midwife Associates, whom I will no longer continue under their care, because of their relationship with Dr. Brotman. Super disappointed by my recent experience around becoming a new patient. Dr Brotman actually attempted a version to turn my breech baby and ultimately delivered my daughter by cesarean birth for the midwives at West Suburban. But she wanted to have a 15 minute in office meeting before too ing forward and would not speak to me over the phone. So I made the 45 min drive with my toddler, we were 15 min early when I arrived and was told Dr Brotman went to check on a patient who had delivered the night before. I was also told she would be no later than 30 min behind on our appt. An hour and 15 min later, she called the office and I chose to leave. When I called my husband to talk through my disappointment, he reminded me that she was 2 hours late to the ECV (version to turn breech position) because she had the time wrong, and 40 min late to our scheduled cesarean birth. And to top it off, she still has not called me back around missing our appointment. Just not professional. Everything I experienced with Dr. Brotman and her office was very unprofessional. I was given a wrong diagnosis and looked for a second. The new doctor suggested a follow up ultrasound not surgery like Dr. B had proposed. My ultrasound report even suggested to have a follow up ultrasound in 4 weeks. When I asked to have records transferred from her office, I get a personal phone call from Dr. B around 7pm. I don't think it is that uncommon for people to seek out second opinions in the first place for surgery, but she seemed extremely irritated I would go behind her back for a second opinion. This was a very personal and threatening phone call. She even went as far to say that I would eventually have to have surgery with my new doctor and they would not put me under anesthesia and would be in a lot of pain. I don't understand this thug like tactic! This moment showed her true colors and I will not be going back to her. I PAID A $500 DEDUCTIBLE TO HER OFFICE AND IT WAS APPLIED TO MY INSURANCE ACCOUNT.. NOW I OWE MY INSURANCE...","After searching for the right OBGYN for prenatal care, I found Dr. Brotman. She delivered my child via Vaginal after my c-section just 16months prior,and was THEE only doctor who said that it could be done. Because of her confidence and knowledge, I trusted in her right away. Yes, she may have ran late with her appointments, but the care I received was well worth waiting for. She was amazing during the course of visits, and detailed every move and made me feel comfortable. She always called back ASAP, answered all questions, and fully explained the things I was not understanding, with patience and grace. If I decide to have another child, she is the one I will call again. I found her to be very nice but there are some serious issues going on with this office. Her office over charged me by $20 every time I visited. Come to find out my insurance notified them of this and they did NOT even contact me to tell me of this they just kept charging me the original way. On top of over charging me she wanted to see me every two weeks, I am not high risk and I'm only 28!! This all lead me to the conclusion that she was just wanting more money by overcharging and wanting to see me too often. On top of all that, I received a phone call from her office saying that my insurance was not accepting them and that I had to call and see what was going on before I would be personally billed the full amount. Of course I called my insurance immediately, and the operator informed me would never under any circumstances contact my doctor they would contact me personally if something like this were actually true. She then went on to inform me that they had accepted her (through formal notification) and had sent her a check paying for my visits!! This would be strange if it didn't seem like her office is money hungry! Why would she threaten to bill me the full amount AFTER she had already gotten paid?! On top of all of this I would wait an average of over 45-60min to be seen and then only have a 5 min visual with the DR. After going through all of this I wanted to change offices immediately and I did but I only needed my medical records. They charge $50 for medical records whether they are faxed or picked up personally. I was very upset at this pricing, but I said I'd pay whatever to stop being in contact with this office, I told them to take the money out of the money that they owed me. IT TOOK THREE WEEKS to get my records faxed to my new Dr. three weeks for a fax is completely absurd! After the office called me over and over and over to see if I was a patient or why I didn't want to be one anymore they finally sent it!! So finally I'm done with this office and spoke with my new Dr and explained what she used to do during visitation and I found out that it is unsafe for my baby to have ultrasounds every visit which is EXACTLY what Brottman was doing.... I would definitely not go back or recommend her for anyone to see under any circumstances. Stayed latex to see me after a partial miscarriage. Gave me her cell number for emergencies. Always spent time addressing my concerns. During my visit I felt that I was treated very well.I would absolutely recommend this doctor to my family and friends.I felt this visit was an amazing success!Overall I would rate this visit : outstanding!",5.0,4.0,9,bad wanted give  e zero thats possible give one shes extremely rude unprofessional experience   referred midwife incredibly rude tactwarmth bedside manor made feel like time disappointed appalled physician took oath fulfill best ability judgment covenant warmth sympathy understanding none ever experienced   bedside manor poor also made question level careconcern patient plan send letter hospital shes affiliated well west suburban midwife associate longer continue care relationship   super disappointed recent experience around becoming new patient   actually attempted version turn breech baby ultimately delivered daughter cesarean birth midwife west suburban wanted 15 minute office meeting ing forward would speak phone made 45 min ive toddler 15 min early arrived told   went check patient delivered night also told would later 30 min behind appt hour 15 min later called office chose leave called husband talk disappointment reminded 2 hour late ecv version turn breech position time wrong 40 min late scheduled cesarean birth top still called back around missing appointment professional everything experienced   office unprofessional given wrong diagnosis looked second new doctor suggested follow ultrasound surgery like  b proposed ultrasound report even suggested follow ultrasound 4 week asked record transferred office get personal phone call  b around 7pm dont think uncommon people seek second opinion first place surgery seemed extremely irritated would go behind back second opinion personal threatening phone call even went far say would eventually surgery new doctor would put anesthesia would lot pain dont understand thug like tactic moment showed true color going back paid 500 deductible office applied insurance account owe insurance,searching right obgyn prenatal care found   delivered child via vaginal csection 16months priorand thee doctor said could done confidence knowledge trusted right away yes may ran late appointment care received well worth waiting amazing course visit detailed every move made feel comfortable always called back asap answered question fully explained thing understanding patience grace decide another child one call found nice serious issue going office office charged 20 every time visited come find insurance notified even contact tell kept charging original way top charging wanted see every two week high risk im 28 lead conclusion wanting money overcharging wanting see often top received phone call office saying insurance accepting call see going would personally billed full amount course called insurance immediately operator informed would never circumstance contact doctor would contact personally something like actually true went inform accepted formal notification sent check paying visit would strange didnt seem like office money hungry would threaten bill full amount already gotten paid top would wait average 4560min seen 5 min visual  going wanted change office immediately needed medical record charge 50 medical record whether faxed picked personally upset pricing said id pay whatever stop contact office told take money money owed took three week get record faxed new  three week fax completely absurd office called see patient didnt want one anymore finally sent finally im done office spoke new  explained used visitation found unsafe baby ultrasound every visit exactly brottman would definitely go back recommend anyone see circumstance stayed latex see partial miscarriage gave cell number emergency always spent time adessing concern visit felt treated welli would absolutely recommend doctor family friendsi felt visit amazing successoverall would rate visit outstanding,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,0,0,0,0,0
124,Dr. Morton I. Hyson,Nevada,"physician and surgeon license reprimanded, must take and pass all five topic areas of Ethics and Boundaries Essay Examination and fined $2,500 due to an adverse action taken by the State of Nevada in November 2020.", Male,2.43,"For the life of me, I can't see what these other folks are crying about. He didn't shy away from my problem, and was actually willing to try something different than the normal Dilantin and Phenobarbital. That med combo wasn't working for me. (It's not one size fits all)Thanks to him, I can drive, and hold a job. But most important, I haven't had a seizure in almost 30 years. When it comes to Doctors, Id rather have results than ""cute"" personalities. After spending 3-5 minutes with Dr. Hyson and $150 I will say that he is the rudest doctor I have ever had to deal with. Very short, kept wondering why we were there without even giving us time to explain our reason for being there. i f you have an appointment with him I would do a consultation with him first just to make sure before you pay the money. I rated staff a 3 because the receptionist was very efficient, really Dr. Hyson wasn't worthy of a 1. Dr hyson is a unfair and rude doctor... I read sume of the reviews and i agree with those other. Reviewer beware dnt waste a dime on his old but Dishonest and rather odd person. Only after insurance money. I went to see Dr Morton Hyson for a brain MRI. He called and went over the results over the phone. He scheduled another appointment shortly after. I assumed for another test. When I came in for my appointment I payed another co-pay, just for him to give me my same results- that he previously gave me over the phone. I explained to Dr Hyson my confusion (due to him already giving me my results) and asked why I had this appointment. He then retaliated and stated that I can no longer see him, and he will give me a refund. All because I asked him what this appointment was for. Left feeling worthless and upset. Made me feel like the seizures and tremors I'm experiencing is something I'm making up. Although he has witnessed my shaking in person and has my hospital reports of being taken to er for a seizure that left me unconscious and unable to function for a week. Because nothing showed up as major on my tests has Told me to quote on quote ""deal with it"" will never go back, nor will I ever reccomend this man. was hopeful because I thought Dr. Hyson was a genius who would be able to help me. Now, I realize that is far from reality. I have a long history of Migraines and other neurological concerns (including a brain injury in 2005). I have not been under the supervision and care of a Neurologist for a very long time. Last month, I would up in the ER with burning and tingling sensations (mostly on the left side of my body). I've also been extremely confused off and on with lapses in memory. Dr. Hyson ordered an MRI of the brain and Ultrasounds. They were going to do an EEG this morning to follow up on a previous EEG (that I had a few years ago). That EEG had shown Left Temporal slowing, and I do have Partial Complex Seizures but it's never been fully diagnosed. I was looking forward to having this done and finally getting some answers. Well... This morning, during my appointment, I heard Dr. Hyson arguing with a patient (on the phone) in the next room. When he came in after he looked my chart (with the test results from the MRI and Ultrasounds (of my Carotid Arteries) for (literally) about 2-5 seconds and said, ""Well, your MRI was normal and you have no evidence of Stroke. You do not have a neurological disorder, so you don't need me anymore."" He, then, walked out of the room... And I followed and left his office... perplexed. And that was that. Umm..... What? Word to the wise.... Go somewhere else. They didn't even follow through with their own testing, and apparently, unless you have an obvious lesion, tumor, Aneurysm, or Stroke, ""You don't have a neurological disorder"", & you definitely don't need this doctor. I am extremely frustrated and disappointed. None of seeing this doctor was inexpensive, and for absolutely nothing. Horrible phony dr. I have spent hours in the military going through torturous emg's that proved i had carpal tunnel, and neuropathy from a neck injury. I spent 5 minutes at dr Hysons' for him to write to the veterans affairs saying there is no problem with anything. He's either a horrible Dr or a flat out liar because i am now having neck surgery so i can stop my arm from going paralyzed for weeks at a time due to neuropathy!! thanks for nothing doc I hope you are getting great kickbacks from the va for wasting my time. I'm likely going to have to pay out of pocket to see a REAL dr. to disprove your crap and spend years appealing to get benefits for my injuries incurred while on active duty. worst doctor ever to vizit ? i do rate him zero ZERO Dr. Hyson is not a chatty person, but he was the only doctor who did not shy away from my problem (neck muscles involuntarily pulling my neck to left). He was also thorough, in that he ordered test that would rule out what the problem is. I had two doctors who stated that did not know what my condition was (neurologist), and I would have travel out of town to find a doctor specializing in movement disorders. Then I looked online and found Dr Hyson. Dr Hyson had confidence and a course of action. This guy is a cattle call doctor. ""take your pills see me in 3 months"" The worst bedside manner, very standoffish and cold. He dose not like to discuss anything","Are we a cash cow? I have been sole caregiver for my husband with Alzheimer's Disease. I went to every appointment with him due to his illness and witnessed first hand the ""two minute max"" appointments. Dr Hyson gave the appearance of not giving a darn about his patient, or myself as caregiver. When I told Hyson that I didn't feel safe he shrugged it off like I had no business talking to him, I wasn't HIS patient. Hyson suggested a psychiatrist for my husband...no support for my feelings of being unsafe as I told Hyson that my husband had been threatening my life. I felt as a professional he could have spent an additional minute of his precious time to direct me somewhere I could get help if he wasn't willing! He prescribed a very mild tranquilizer for him that did nothing to de-escalate when hubby was acting out. I never did understand why we were using Hyson's services. May my husband RIP, the suffering is over no thanks to Hyson. Dr. Hyson has restored my hope that I can be well again. He seemed sincerely concerned and talked to me a lot, asking many questions. I can't remember the last time a doctor spent more than a couple of minutes with me. He was very sympathetic to my suffering and even with my financially ability to afford something that isn't covered by my insurance. I meet back with him tomorrow to discuss the results of my brain scan and head MRI I'm feeling optimistic. Dr Hyson I use that loosely, he exemplifies the term get your license from a cracker jacks box. Dr. Hyson's demeanor is that of a bump on a log, he enters the examine room with a swagger as if you are in the presence of a world renowned specialist., which in reality he is as useless as a three dollar bill. When presented with a very rare neurological auto immune, central nervous system disease (Stiff Person Syndrome) Dr. Hyson's Exact word's ""what do you want me to do for you"" end quote. seeing as he the certified and supposed educated Dr, FIND A AVENUE FOR TREATMENT . The last neurologist that treated my patient, UNFORTUNATELY is back in CA was short of being honored to treat my patient. on the first visit he had a student with him and he stated to the student that he was having a very rare opportunity in his lap and may never see a case like this in his career that was just starting. Dr Gilbert Ho of Poway Ca who has the pacific center for neurology and is now working with the mayo clinic. so in short the major difference and obvious example of a well educated neurologist . a obvious night and day difference and proof that Mr Hyson can wear a white coat and smile pretending to be a doctor has no clue on how to treat a real problem when presented. I strongly urge the licensing board of nevada and the physician licensing board to review these reviews and launch a independent review of Mr Hyson and protect patients from a hack like this. I am care giver and never have i seen such an incompetent individual in my life. DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANY REASON Seems only interested in ""publish-worthy clients"". If problem doesn't revolve around the brain, he's not interested, blows you off & doesn't answer questions. If you're ""not worthy"", the least he could do is refer you to another Neurologist; but he just writes you off. I was early to my appt. so they took me earlier. I got an EEG from Dr.Montoya and saw Dr.Hyson right after.He listened to my symptoms and asked a few details about my migraine history. I walked away with a real plan of action. Meds and an Mri to begin. So far so good with the time he spent with me. dr.hyson is the best.i have been with him for 12 years,he is very awsome and careing. easy to make appointments with him.staff awsome also. thanks dr.

I would recomend him to all I know. My husband had shoulder surgery in feb of this year. His arm looked infected 1 week later took him to see Komanduri he said it was fine that it was not infected. That evening i rushed him to hospital were he was admitted for 4 days do to a horriable infection. Dr komanduri never came to see him and he was wrong it was an infection. They then put a picc line in so i could administer antibiotics at home and he started having chest pains 2 days later took him back to hospital and they admitted him again for a blood clot where the picc line was. He now has a centarl line in his neck. My husband has had a horriable experience with Dr.K would not recommed him to a dog he has horriable bedside manners and he does not know a horriable infection when he see's one. Really do you research on Doctors before you let them do surgery if I would have read these reviews before all this happened I would not have choosen Dr.Komanduri. Very rude,did not give the opportunity to answer questions,walked out of the exam room while being asked a question.I needed a second surgery exactly one month after the first one to correct the problem.He is a professional and in my opinion should have fixed my knee correctly the first time. Botched my ACL surgery, left a screw sticking up through my knee where the tendon had been attached to. Very scary and seemed too busy to care about patient as an individual. dr. komanduri incorrectly put pins in my sons arm - how do i know his nurse told me he did because by this time the pins had become infected and they were just having us come in 2xs a week 2 have casts on then off then oh its swollen how about a splint instead duh and oh the radiologist called to tell us they were not positioned right - i decided not to take my son back ther because of this and you want to know what they did??? called dcfs to investigate me for medical neglect although i beleive my son was neglected by them. in case u r wondering the outcome mk ortho it was unfounded i took my son to a real doctor to get the infected pins that his body was rejecting due to not being properly put in - and this guy was graet he even said no more surgery and you guys told me when th pins came out another surgery for more pins!do you call dcfs on everyone or wait patients u screw up alot worse then try to have the parents take your blame. thank at least for the humor","After a bad fall I needed shoulder surgery. My rotator cuff, slap and bicep tendon were torn. I also had a few fractures and a pocket whole in my shoulder that required bone marrow from my hip. He was fabulous not only in professionalism but with care and kindness. He's great!! I would give this butcher zero stars if possible. Beware of this doctor! He’s very charismatic. He had me fooled...but he is a BUTCHER! Make sure you get a second opinion before he touches you! He is kind and really cares about his patients. He can't perform miracles but he will do his best to help. Unlike others he tells you like it is. I wouldn't go to any other orthopedists he is the best. Dr. Komanduri is very knowledgeable, doesn't hold nothing back, and gives it to you like it is. He's willing to work with you and really cares for his patients. I went in knowing I needed to have surgery on my shoulder. I didn't know what to expect but I figured it would suck. It's been about 3 months since my surgery and my shoulder is feeling great. The experience was not bad at all. I'd definitely recommend Dr. Komanduri and the staff at MK Orthopedics. Great Surgeon, but this doctor is late to everything. If a patient has a scheduled appointment with this doctor be prepared to wait. When I first came to Dr. Komanduri I had a very tough case due to 2 failed knee replacements from another facility. I was quiet a challenge to Dr. Komanduri and had a lifestyle that did not support healing in the best way. Through recommendation of Dr. Komanduri and the medical staff team, I changed my lifestyle, picked up better eating habits and actually developed a restaurant business from it. Stopped smoking with their help, I am working out 4 days per week, walking. I'm in the best shape of my life due to this incredible practice. Thank you Dr. Komanduri and medical staff of MK Orthopaedics! After a skiing incident caused considerable damage to my shoulder, I visited Dr. Komanduri at MK Orthopaedics in Joliet on the recommendation of my brother and both of my parents who, due to various sports related injuries, have been patients of his over the past twenty years. Folks- this is a one stop shop that’ll get you imaging, diagnosis, surgery, and physical therapy in an absolute seamless, simple and professional manner. 

The process started with a visit to examine my shoulder literally three days after my incident occurred. X-rays were completed on site in a matter of ten minutes and I was able to get an MRI with contrast a mere two days later. It became clear surgery would be needed to return my functionality back to normal. 

Surgery was a simple process with the nurses, anesthesiologist, and surgeon being sure to put me at ease from the moment I walked in the door. Communication was nothing short of excellent. Before I knew it, I was waking up and heading home with my newly repaired shoulder. 

Having nearly unlimited options of facilities to choose from, I chose to stick with MK Orthopaedics for physical therapy. My reasoning was that Dr. Komanduri would have full control to alter my therapy protocol and monitor my progress by simply walking to the other side of the building. This proved to be key in my quick recovery- I regained 100% of my movement and functionality within two months of my surgery. Having zero pain and full functionality in that short of a time span is absolutely outstanding. I’m not trying to sugar coat the recovery and therapy process as it can be a LONG road and take a lot of effort- but these guys truly made it a manageable and enjoyable experience. I worked with every physical therapist on staff at some point along with most of the technicians. Everyone I encountered was an absolute pleasure to work with. It was easy to see they enjoyed their work and truly cared about my recovery. 

Dr. Komanduri and everyone at MK Orthopaedics is the epitome of professionalism. I can honestly say I look back fondly on the entire experience, and I absolutely recommend their services to anyone else in need. Thank you! I could not be more satisfied with Dr. Komanduri's work. My wrist was shattered into many pieces. His single, but complicated, operational procedure put my wrist back to where it belonged. Then, with his direction, his physical therapy staff got my wrist back to almost perfect. I would have been happy to have gotten back to 80% considering the damage present before surgery, but an almost 99% recovery cannot be beat. I cannot say enough to thank Dr. Komanduri for his work. Additionally, I have spoken to others who have personally experienced the doctor's work and have reflected similar praises. Dr. Komanduri is a caring individual who has helped me recover after an accident with his surgical skills. Thank you Dr. Komanduri Dr. Komanduri gave me a couple of options for my painful knee. He performed arthroscopic knee surgery and I am now limp and pain free. He is a great, knowledgeable, caring doctor. Dr. Komanduri did my total hip replacement, tibia repair. I was in a head on car accident. He took very good care of me. Very compassionate , great surgeon. Thanks for helping me walk again . Dr. Komanduri has been my orthopedic surgeon for almost 30 yrs. He and his staff are compassionate, precise, and attentive. Dr. Komanduri replaced my hip in 1998, and it lasted longer than the average hip replacement was estimated to last. I had hip revision in August of 2014, and I was released and satisfied with the results, of the surgery, just this week! Dr. thank you for allowing me to walk without pain again. Dr. is by far heads above the rest! DR. Komanduri is the best! Love his bedside manner. His staff is exceptional! I will recommend him to anyone! Dr. Komanduri is the most knowledgeable and caring doctor I have met. Between me and my husband he has done 2 knee and 1 shoulder surgeries all with perfect result and quick recoveries. Although he might not have the warmest bedside manners, Dr. Komanduri truly cares about your pain and fixing it. He takes his time and will talk with you and answer all your questions and concerns. And he really listens to you -- not just nodding his head then doing what he wants. If you don't ask or talk to him, he might come off as abrupt. But if you engage with him, he will take as much time as YOU need. I have had surgery on my knees prior to my experience with Dr Komanduri and the difference was night and day. He is by far the best ortho Doctor I have experienced dr.kumanduri is the most empathtic doctor I have ever been to. He takes his time and really listens.Also, he zeroes in on the problem aliveating pain.I would recommend him and value the time he has given me. HAD KNEE REPLACEMENT IN FEBRUARY. ALL IS GOOD., DR.WAS VERY HELPFUL AND ATTENTIVE TO MY PROBLEMS AND ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS SATISFACTORILY. WOULD RECCOMEND HIM TO ANYONE WITH ORTHOPEDIC PROBLEMS. THE OFFICE STAFF WERE WONDERFUL AND THE THERAPISTS WERE ALL EXCELLENT. Doc fixed my shoulder and was released in a little over three months. Great people in the office. Ignore the negative reviews. He is very respectful, cares about his patients, and is NOT quick to shove a surgery down your throat. He gave me the option of physical therapy before even suggesting surgery. I went for the 2nd option and had surgery on my shoulder, which went extremely well. I am 3 months out of surgery right now and I'm near 100% recovery. Friends and family have had surgeries performed by him, and all went as well as mine. I would also recommend MK physical therapy - all therapists were kind and very knowledgeable. Dr. Komanduri is a brilliant doctor whom I would recommend to anyone with an orthopedic concern. I felt like he cared about my health and recovery. The physical therapy staff was also very caring and took great strides to aid my understanding of my recovery process. Had surgery on my left shoulder for rotator cuff and other problems. I am back to full mobility but I am working on my strength. Doing great. He is doing a knee replacement on my husband in November. I would recommend Dr.Komanduri to EVERYONE! My son had almost a compound fracture in his wrist which needed surgery right away. I contacted 5 orthopedic doctors and the only one who responded was Dr. Komanduri. He saw my son right away and was in surgery the next morning. He was great explaining every step that went on. I feel very lucky he was the doctor who stepped up in this emergency. My son's surgery went great and am very thankful!! The staff over there is the best!! I would never go anywhere else. Dr. Komanduri has such a wonderful personality and really takes the time to explain things and answer questions. I highly recommend him!!! Dr.Komanduri is the best! He did my total hip replacement and I was walking without a cane after only 5 weeks. I highly recommend Dr. Komanduri! I have been to Dr. Komanduri for a knee surgery and also for a hip labrum tear. He evaluated my knee and diagnosed me with a torn meniscus. He wanted to be sure his office evaluation was accurate so he ordered an MRI to be sure. His diagnosis was exact. He offered me various options for treatment which included physical therapy, but due to the fact my pain was increasing I made the decision to have the surgery. He did an actual ""repair"", not a ""menisectomy"". The recovery time was longer but he did ""save"" my meniscus and saved me from difficulties in the future. I have had great success and my knee is better than ever! I also saw him for hip pain which again he diagnosed accurately and had an MRI to be sure. He again gave me options and I decided to wait for surgical intervention. My hip labrum healed and feels great. I value is knowledge and skill and would highly recommend him to others. His bedside manner can be a bit dry but I cannot dispute his knowledge as a physician",5.0,25.0,36,understanding doc take fix problem would recomend know husband shoulder surgery feb year arm looked

Cho ask how I was & said he would fix my problem & I would be feeling better soon . When I woke up from surgery I was feeling so much better. Thank you Dr. Cho I saw Dr CHO following an elevated PSA Test. He was very good and explained the issue very well. He is very competent in his field and makes you feel at ease. He takes the time to review your file before he sees you so he is very aware of who you are and how you might be feeling. A true professional who seems to be genuinely interested in your well-being. Dr.Cho has been helping me with a bladder problem for a little while now, the problem has not yet been solved but he seems to be doing test after test after test, explaining things along the way, which makes me feel confident that he will find the problem.He takes his time to listen to all I have to say, comes across as a very caring professional. He does run late a lot of the time but that's OK because I know he will take the extra time with me as well if he needs to.I recommend Dr. Cho to anyone who needs a urologist.

Highly Recommend. Out of all the doctors I have seen we find Dr.Cho is one of the most compassionate and caring..We are happy to have him looking after our father thank you Great doctor. The best way for me to describe him and his skills is “He is all you want, what you want in a doctor”. Nothing but praise for this man. very pleasant, very confident, very professional, always discusses what is going on and I never feel rushed Very cosiderate Doctor, a real gentleman , surgery very successful, Wonderful ""Bedside"" Manor -- comforting, and calming. Wonderful Surgeon. He's 5 Stars in my opinion. The procedure to eliminate my Kidney stone was both explained clearly, and Done. Thank You, Dr. Cho ! I would highly recommend Dr. Cho this past weekend he fixed my ureterocele which fixed my kidney infection. He was the in house urologist for Victoria hospital this past weekend & I am so thankful he was there. He came in & said I am dr. Cho ask how I was & said he would fix my problem & I would be feeling better soon . When I woke up from surgery I was feeling so much better. Thank you Dr. Cho I saw Dr CHO following an elevated PSA Test. He was very good and explained the issue very well. He is very competent in his field and makes you feel at ease. He takes the time to review your file before he sees you so he is very aware of who you are and how you might be feeling. A true professional who seems to be genuinely interested in your well-being. Dr.Cho has been helping me with a bladder problem for a little while now, the problem has not yet been solved but he seems to be doing test after test after test, explaining things along the way, which makes me feel confident that he will find the problem.He takes his time to listen to all I have to say, comes across as a very caring professional. He does run late a lot of the time but that's OK because I know he will take the extra time with me as well if he needs to.I recommend Dr. Cho to anyone who needs a urologist.

I booked a 3pm appointment with my family doctor, Dr. Cavataio, for medication refills. I sat an hour in the waiting room before I asked the receptionist if they had skipped over me. It was interesting that the person taken in ahead of me, knew the receptionist quite well. She told me to have a seat by another door. I was taken in, and waited another half and hour. I opened the door, to see what was going on. Someone came by, and I was told to shut the door. After an hour and a half I was seen by his ASSISTANT. I PAID FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DOCTOR. I WAS NOT SEEN BY A DOCTOR. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HIS PATIENTS! Have gone here several times in the past as his office is one of very few urgent care clinics in the area.

My husband didn't go to the doctor before we met Dr. Cacataio for a urgent care visit. I am also willing to wait for him. Lots of in office waiting. But if you get there very early in the morning or right after lunch it's a much shorter wait time. Dr. Cavataio is an exceptional doctor. I believe he has a huge case load, but still takes the time to listen to your concerns. He's genuinely concerned for your well being; he's good in writing prescriptions, refers to a specialist if needed, etc. I would recommend this doctor. Do NOT book an appointment with Dr. Pietro A.

Variakojis,Illinois,physician and surgeon license restored to indefinite probation for a minimum of three years with multiple conditions including a practice monitor, Female,3.53,"Good Dr until she just disappeared April of 2017. No warning, no notice, just completely abandoned her suffering chronic pain patients. Leaving senior citizens whom she hooked on narcotics scrambling to find other doctors, going to ER's or simply going through withdrawl. 

The creed of ""Do no harm"" not in her vocabulary. There should be criminal punishment for such behavior! Very knowledgeable, highly-trained and empathetic pain specialist. Helped me immensely with my carpal tunnel syndrome. Don't be dissuaded by slightly longer wait times--great doctors have a lot of patients wanting to see them. I also don't understand gripes about controlled substances--there are strict rules that doctors have to follow about such medications. With all the headaches (pun intended) physicians have to face these days due to insurance issues, Obamacare, etc., it is certainly not ""all about making money"". Physicians have to work twice as hard to make a fraction of what they used to. I am in a medical field, I know how difficult it has become for many doctors. They wait for visits was terrible. I wasn't on any controlled substances, but she wouldn't refill my prescription if I was late seeing her. It's all about making money. She was trying to push me into doing treatments I didn't want to do. Her staff was downright rude. They also REFUSED to submit paperwork to the online pharmacy to get a special pain cream covered for me. Pretty much it wasn't even a slightly good experience working with her and her office. When saw Dr. V, I was in severe constant chronic pain from post concussion syndrome, neck and upper spinal problems for 33 years. Plus lupus, fibro and R.A. V gave worst initial visit ever from a ""pain specialist."" Barely looked at forms and reports from drs, asked few questions, and insisted I try meds I had tried several times. I never said a word even tho meds were listed as taken, and reactions: all terrible. Usual wait was 2- 4 hours. I decided to see what she could do. Three more times she gave me meds I had already tried 2 or 3 times each for 4 months. Two of those times I had severe serotonin syndrome reactions ever though I warned her about having it previously. Getting meds a nightmare. If saw her on exact day meds due, she wrote your script. Otherwise, had to call nurse and ask her to mail them.If scripts not arrive, nurse screamed at me for not reminding her. If I called to remind, nurse screamed because she sent them out. After 19 visits, quit, just horror show","Dr V. has treated me for a very serious spinal condition with the resulting unrelenting pain for 5 years. She has exhibited extensive knowledge , as well as, an unending empathy for my condition. Her staff are thoughtful, helpful and efficient as well as cheerful. Over 30 to 40 visits I have waited more than 45 minutes once or twice. Dr V. and her staff are a valued partner/addition in the health care environment of Palos Heights Il.

Highest recommendation possible. Dr. V. has treated the pain in my neck and shoulders. She spends a lot of time with her patients and the results are amazing. Her treatments have worked wonders. I highly recommend her. Excellent caring physician, was extremely helpful with my chronic pain, would recommend highly Dr V truly cares about my condition and spends as much time as necessary to understand my concerns. She is the most understanding doctor that I have seen in the last three years and would not change for anything. My waits are short and the staff is friendly. I'd recommend this is a well-rounded office and a fantastic doctor!",4.0,4.0,8,good  disappeared april 2017 warning notice completely abandoned suffering chronic pain patient leaving senior citizen hooked narcotic scrambling find doctor going er simply going withawl creed harm vocabulary criminal punishment behavior knowledgeable highlytrained empathetic pain specialist helped immensely carpal tunnel synome dont dissuaded slightly longer wait timesgreat doctor lot patient wanting see also dont understand gripe controlled substancesthere strict rule doctor follow medication headache pun intended physician face day due insurance issue obamacare etc certainly making money physician work twice hard make fraction used medical field know difficult become many doctor wait visit terrible wasnt controlled substance wouldnt refill prescription late seeing making money trying push treatment didnt want staff downright rude also refused submit paperwork online pharmacy get special pain cream covered pretty much wasnt even slightly good experience working office saw  v severe constant chronic pain post concussion synome neck upper spinal problem 33 year plus lupus fibro ra v gave worst initial visit ever pain specialist barely looked form report s asked question insisted try med tried several time never said word even tho med listed taken reaction terrible usual wait 2 4 hour decided see could three time gave med already tried 2 3 time 4 month two time severe serotonin synome reaction ever though warned previously getting med nightmare saw exact day med due wrote script otherwise call nurse ask mail themif script arrive nurse screamed reminding called remind nurse screamed sent 19 visit quit horror show, v treated serious spinal condition resulting unrelenting pain 5 year exhibited extensive knowledge well unending empathy condition staff thoughtful helpful efficient well cheerful 30 40 visit waited 45 minute twice  v staff valued partneraddition health care environment palos height il highest recommendation possible  v treated pain neck shoulder spends lot time patient result amazing treatment worked wonder highly recommend excellent caring physician extremely helpful chronic pain would recommend highly  v truly care condition spends much time necessary understand concern understanding doctor seen last three year would change anything wait short staff friendly id recommend wellrounded office fantastic doctor,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,0.000128672,0.714,1,1,1,0,0

Waste of time and money. Was of no help Don't do it! I was sent to Dr. Ahuja for an ADD evaluation. I was only needing a letter for college so I could utilize special study options like audio textbooks,and un-timed testing and different methods of learning and comprehending. I verified THREE different times with her receptionist that this Dr. was who I needed to see. Only to go and her say she could not diagnose me or give me the letter for school. However she could give me this MEDICATION for add and I could come back ever 30 days for a appointment and refill. My question is how can you give me such powerful drugs for a problem you wont diagnose. The medication made me feel like I was shooting espresso.She does not want me using the services at school because I wouldnt need to come in every 30 days for a refill of this poison she is pedaling. She spent the rest of the appt trying to convince me I was depressed and I needed to be medicated for that also. Total bunk! There are other options for people with learning problems.","Dr. Ahuja is very professional and has been flexible in treating my illness. Although I am hesitant about change(my OCD) I believe that she is trying to work with me on managing my symptoms. Her staff is nice and usually attentive, and her nurses are pretty thorough. Dr. Ahuja is also working with my psychologist to find out the best way to approach treatment, both cognitively and medically. I randomly picked Dr Ahuja from a list given to me by my weight loss surgeon for a psych evaluation (required for surgery). Well, boy did I make a mistake. Yes, I love food, or I would not be in this situation in the first place, that's a no-brainer. I am already going to support meetings thru my weight loss clinic & have lots of family support. Dr Ahuja wouldn't clear me for surgery until I see a counselor who will take me grocery shopping to pick out healthy food & attend support meetings. LOL! I'm fat, not stupid. Now my surgery will be set back by a few months. I wasn't depressed before, but Dr. Ahuja has done her best to drag me down. Oh and she has a large blackhead on her nose that needs to be popped, not to mention I question the opinion of anyone who wears olive and orange printed pants with a bright red blazer. I love Dr. Ahuja. She lays out the options and guides treatment without forcing anything. We met after my previous doctor retired. In Southern Illinois, I've had many unfitting experiences with general practitioners and specialists. Dr. Ahuja isn't afraid to choose science over politics, and I trust that she cares about my quality of life. I look forward to our meetings. While our relationship is entirely professional, I must say she is not only brilliant, but is quite ravishing too. Hope I don't sound biased--it's just really hard to think of anything critical; we've never had any disagreements. Being diplomatic, honest, and focusing on treatment instead of denial has served me well with her. I hope she stays in the Energy area for a long time. :)",2.0,3.0,5,bad experience waste time money help dont sent   add evaluation needing letter college could utilize special study option lie audio textboosand untimed testing different method learning comprehending verified three different time receptionist  needed see go say could diagnose give letter school however could give medication add could come bac ever 30 day appointment refill question give powerful ug problem wont diagnose medication made feel lie shooting espressoshe want using service school wouldnt need come every 30 day refill poison pedaling spent rest appt trying convince depressed needed medicated also total bun option people learning problem,  professional flexible treating illness although hesitant changemy ocd believe trying wor managing symptom staff nice usually attentive nurse pretty thorough   also woring psychologist find best way approach treatment cognitively medically randomly piced   list given weight loss surgeon psych evaluation required surgery well boy mae mistae yes love food would situation first place thats nobrainer already going support meeting thru weight loss clinic lot family support   wouldnt clear surgery see counselor tae grocery shopping pic healthy food attend support meeting lol im fat stupid surgery set bac month wasnt depressed   done best ag oh large blachead nose need popped mention question opinion anyone wear olive orange printed pant bright red blazer love   lay option guide treatment without forcing anything met previous doctor retired southern illinois ive many unfitting experience general practitioner specialist   isnt afraid choose science politics trust care quality life loo forward meeting relationship entirely professional must say brilliant quite ravishing hope dont sound biasedits really hard thin anything critical weve never disagreement diplomatic honest focusing treatment instead denial served well hope stay energy area long time,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.005215706,0.999999,0.885415059,0.842,0.999999,0.994090524,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,6.24e-05,0.856,1,1,1,1,0
147,Dr. Rian J. Rowles,Illinois,physician and surgeon license placed on indefinite probation with conditions including practice monitor and controlled substance license surrendered with conditions for improper prescribing of opiates in his psychology practice, Male,2.72,"I am appalled that this Dr. does not care for his patients enough to return call and even respond to letters informing him of our son's crisis. Our son is mentally ill so projects that he is just fine when in reality he is in profound distress and pain. This Dr should be turning to his family members to get the correct picture. Our son is addicted to Adderall prescribed by this Dr. and over the year has manifested a complete change of personality. He has become paranoid, suspicious, angry and combative with moods spiking and falling throughout the day. Naturally, we witness this when he is not in the presence of his DR., who proclaims he is A-OK after a mere 10 minute visit. Dr. Rowles is a drug dealer and never return calls! He is unethical and a terrible doctor! This dr is terrible all his does is prescribe medication without seeing his patient . As far as I'm concerned he is just a legal drug pusher !! Terrible very unethical !!! Does not call back even when message is left. Nice guy but the wait is terrible I absolutely do not recommend if you need anything more than an occasional office visit. Totally unresponsive to calls, pages and all requests for assistance. On one occasion, it took more than two months to finally get a callback while a family member was undergoing treatment. More recently, an appointment was cancelled without explanation and even as a current patient, the next availability was two months in the future. While that was an issue which I appealed with office staff to no avail, after almost four weeks of multiple calls and messages to the doctor for assistance I have yet to receive a response. As a practitioner whose occupation involves treating patients in crisis and/or taking prescribed medication which requires monitoring, this is inexcusable. He seems genuine and caring while in your presence, but is totally inaccessible once you leave his office. Dr never calls patients back! 1st visit had to wait 45 minutes i would not use this facility again..... This man has been saving my life for over 2 years now. He listens, spends all the time I need with me, is exceptionally knowledgable about meds and PTSD, anxiety and depression. Excellent bedside manner. Young so he'll be around for my whole life!

Baber,Illinois,"physician and surgeon license reprimanded and fined $4,000 due to the violation of private health information rights of numerous patients", Male,2.42,"Our son died under his care. Deplorable example of a supposedly Dr Dr. Baber recently changed my daughter's meds. After 2 weeks we noticed significant changes...and NOT in a good way. I called his office on a friday morning (9am) asking for him to call me to discuss what I've noticed. I waited until 8pm...no call. I called again first thing the following Monday (9am.) The receptionist remembered me and said she would page him right away. I waited until 8pm. Still, no call. Today is Tuesday. I did not call. Nor did he. Dr. Baber DOES NOT CARE about the well-being his patients. This is painfully obvious. Now I need to find a new doctor/psychiatrist for my child before her mental health is at serious risk. I am so very disappointed. And worried. DO NOT put your children in his care. Baer is a deplorable and despicable example of what he calls himself a physician. He is a liar and does not care about anything but his pocketbook. Our son took his life under his care This man saved my life and my marriage. I could not recommend a better doctor. I see a different doctor, but want to comment on the office staff. They are difficult to understand, inefficient, and apathetic. They always claim not to have received requests from my pharmacy, but then find them when I become persistent about it. They don't explain things well. There is no warmth. It's apparent to me that they don't care about the patients. I'm giving a high rating for knowledge, based on the doctor I see. He came from Pakistan purely to make money. He is a liar and very bad with my son who committed suicide. He should be sent back!! Baber is a control freak over his patients, yet this practice has the most disorganized office support staff I have ever encountered. I think the office is staffed by Baber's relatives A nightmare medical office !!- I saw a doctor associated with Dr. Baber approximately 5 years ago. The office support staff was horrible. I paid my HMO co-pay. The doctor's staff screwed up on the paperwork to be submitted to the HMO. HMO didn't pay doctor for one of the visits. I talked to the HMO & they told me I didn't need to pay anything further. This doctor's staff has been harassing me & sending me bills for close to 5 years for an amount that I am not responsible for. - MM 02/19/08","z a MD reviews

Warning to current and former patients. The local news (NBC) profiled a story on this Dr. Riaz Baber of Naperville. All of his patient records were carelessly and deliberately left behind in the basement of a home that he then rented out to a lady. The lady discovered the thousands of confidential patient records he had left sitting around in the basement. She and others had complete access to these records. These records included patient names, addresses, DOB, SSN, DL Info, Credit Card Info, Diagnosis Info, Insurance Info, Medication Info, etc. The reporters showed images of all the records in the basement stacked up out in the open. The renter said she contacted various agencies but no one did anything. If you were or are a patient you should contact an attorney. By law this Doctor was suppose to safeguard your information.

Here is a link to the story:

http://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/Trove-of-Sensitive-Medical-Records-Discovered-in-Aurora-Basement-416789683.html Very helpful And knowledgable , kind professional. See adults and adolescent. Busy hard to appointment. Office staff is nice nice big office not very crowded. I had a good experience. Dr was polite and I felt he is very caring. I never felt rushed at all. I always felt like Dr. Baber was more interested in seeing as many patients as possible in order to make as much money as possible, rather than taking the time to treat me with care. He would spend an average of 5-10 minutes with me and then write a prescription. Also, I didn't always feel that he was listening to me. I was Dr. Baber’s patient for 6 years and credit him with saving my life. He treated me for depression with therapy and antidepressants until I learned to cope on my own. My drinking problem halted, I quit smoking, I learned to enjoy life, and even got a college degree. To the reviewer claiming he’s a control freak, I rebuke this accusation. My treatment involved expert medical care from this exceptionally talented and trusted psychoanalyst and never once did I sense a control freak. Insurance problems? Seriously, who doesn’t have them? My annual coverage expired at 6 months and Dr. Baber worked with my insurance and me to keep my treatment schedule in tact and resolved my insurance issues to my satisfaction. I consider Dr. Baber to be an exceptional human being, a caring and considerate doctor, and an expert psychiatrist. I’m certain he can help you too if you let him. He saved me from myself and I’m eternally grateful to him for it.",8.0,5.0,13,son died cre deplorble exmple supposedly   bber recently chnged dughter med 2 week noticed significnt chngesnd good wy clled office fridy morning 9m sking cll discus ive noticed wited 8pmno cll clled first thing following mondy 9m receptionist remembered sid would pge right wy wited 8pm still cll tody tuesdy cll  bber cre wellbeing ptient pinfully obvious need find new doctorpsychitrist child mentl helth serious risk disppointed worried put child cre ber deplorble despicble exmple cll physicin lir cre nything pocketbook son took life cre mn sved life mrrige could recommend better doctor see different doctor wnt comment office stff difficult understnd inefficient pthetic lwys clim received request phrmcy find become persistent dont explin thing well wrmth pprent dont cre ptient im giving high rting knowledge bsed doctor see cme pkistn purely mke money lir bd son committed suicide sent bck bber control frek ptient yet prctice disorgnized office support stff ever encountered think office stffed bbers reltive nightmre medicl office sw doctor ssocited  bber pproximtely 5 yer go office support stff horrible pid hmo copy doctor stff screwed pperwork submitted hmo hmo didnt py doctor one visit tlked hmo told didnt need py nything doctor stff hrssing sending bill close 5 yer mount responsible mm 021908,z md review google review summry 5 4 3 2 1 20 5 review google review helpful google user google user lst week wrning current former ptient locl news nbc profiled story   bber nperville ptient record crelessly delibertely left behind bsement home rented ldy ldy discovered thousnd confidentil ptient record left sitting round bsement others complete ccess record record included ptient nme dess dob ssn dl info credit crd info dignosis info insurnce info mediction info etc reporter showed imge record bsement stcked open renter sid contcted vrious gency one nything ptient contct ttorney lw doctor suppose sfegurd informtion link story httpwwwnbcchicgocominvestigtionstroveofsensitivemediclrecordsdiscoveredinurorbsement416789683html helpful knowledgble kind professionl see dult dolescent busy hrd ppointment office stff nice nice big office crowded good experience  polite felt cring never felt rushed lwys felt like  bber interested seeing mny ptient possible order mke much money possible rther tking time tret cre would spend verge 510 minute write prescription lso didnt lwys feel listening  bbers ptient 6 yer credit sving life treted depression therpy ntidepressnt lerned cope inking problem hlted quit smoking lerned enjoy life even got college degree reviewer climing he control frek rebuke ccustion tretment involved expert medicl cre exceptionlly tlented trusted psychonlyst never sense control frek insurnce problem seriously doesnt nnul coverge expired 6 month  bber worked insurnce keep tretment schedule tct resolved insurnce issue stisfction consider  bber exceptionl humn cring considerte doctor expert psychitrist im certin help let sved im eternlly grteful,1.55e-05,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.002488894,0.715,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,0.001302709,0.999999,0.046635725,0.999999,0.578,1,1,0,0,0
149,Dr. Rizwan Danish,Michigan,"Incompetence;
Negligence", Male,2.28,"Dr Danish treated my disease as cancer, but it is NOT. He knew the proper treatment and when I received my records from him, it noted, ‘if chemo didn’t work, suggest HIPEC, ‘

HIPEC is a surgery and would not bring money into the practice (which he owns) so he never recommended the proper treatment.

His staff is completely untrained in basic port sanitation practices and the infusion center is filthy. 

I would not wish this man on my worst enemy. First visit waited 3.5 hours. 2nd visit waited almost an hour to be seen. He never introduced himself. Was unprepared for our visit. Did not even have test results in front of him, had to have a nurse look them up. Then proceeded to give wrong information regarding a biopsy. Rude to faimily members. It was a waste of precious time with a very poor prognosis to begin with. Don' go to this person! AWFUL EXPERIENCE! I would not refer anyone to Dr. Danish. Unorganized, had no clue what was going on with my case, was rude when I or my family asked questions... .HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. how does this man continue to be allowed to practice medicine !!!! Is it all abut the money ...so many people die under his care !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A real a**-hole, NO PATIENCE, cold hearted. I'd give a ""zero rating"" if I could. I really wish I had the option to give Dr. Danish zero stars, but I am forced to give him a 1 star. As another person mentioned in these reviews, Dr. Danish has no compassion or empathy for any of his patients. When my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Dr. Danish demanded they we have a family meeting at 1pm. My family arrived early to discuss treatment options for my grandmother only to find that Dr. Danish was no where to be found. After patiently waiting for the time being we approached the nurse and informed her that Dr. Danish scheduled a appointment with us at 1pm. The nurse called Dr. Danish and he informed her that he was running late. He finally arrived 2 HOURS later stating that he had stepped out to lunch. Does it really take 2 hours to grab a bite to eat? Especially with my family frantically worrying about the condition of my grandmother. This man has a phobia of germs and will not shake your hand to avoid any contamination. How can you be a doctor if you're constantly surrounded by germs? A co-worker of mine whose father was diagnosed with terminal cancer had Dr. Danish as his oncologist as well and he told me he did the same thing to his dad. Please do NOT let this man be involved in any care for you or your family members or you will regret it. This man is heartless and very cruel! Dr. Danish treated our mother - she walked into his office less than five months ago -healthy -strong positive attitude and a small spot of cancer on her esophagus - mom had a serious reaction from the chemotherapy and radiation -she was in severe pain -could not eat or swallow for months. Mom lost all of her strength and needed assistance 

Dr. Danish continued to send her home with more pain medicine saying she would heal. He felt she did not need a feeding tube and would be fine. Within days ...

 Hemoglobin levels tanked & she was hospitalized on November 8, 2016 at Genesis regional hospital (another huge mistake of the competency of that hospital staff)

 dr. danish would walk in look at mom and walk back out the door ...told our family "" I've never seen a patient react this bad ""

 Further complications mom developed pneumonia because she laid in a hospital bed for 30 days and then Dr. Danish said he's off the case because now it's a lung issue 

 Mom died January 5, 2017 may she rest in peace and we pray our family will forgive the incompetency of Dr. danish 

 He comes on being very knowledgeable and after reading all these reviews everyone is true -he walks in the hospital room looks at the patient walks back out. Our mother had serious reactions from radiation and chemo therapy. Dr. Danish continued to send her home with more pain medicine saying she would heal unfortunately she became severely I had Dr Danish for a doctor and I left him . I was not happy with the way he handled my treatment. I still have cancer but went with someone else. This team understands that a doctor needs to listen to his patients. And Dr Danish does not. And your wait is terrible. No one should have to wait that long. I would not refer him to Anyone. Gave us no hope, and thinks immunotherapy is a waste of time. Wait for 2to4 hours,appointment 5 min or less. Totally unpredpared for appt. Good doctor, wait time is horrible, always more then 2 hours behind My family member had a horrible experience with him. He was always in a hurry and when my family member was hospitalized he would show up for two seconds early in the morning pop his head in the room and then would leave with giving an update of what was happening. We were not impressed. I do NOT recommend that anyone go to Dr. Danish! He is arrogant and condescending. He thinks nothing of making very ill patients wait over 2 hrs. and makes no apologies. He is indecisive with his treatment plans, provides no follow up care between visits and overall leaves his patients feeling confused. He does NOT respond well to questions from patients or their family members and doesn't explain his treatment process. He has taken on too many patients and you are truly treated like a number by him and his office staff. Because of his incompetence, he caused 2 long ICU hospitalizations that were unnecessary due to his inability of use proper follow up care. Don't be fooled by his “hugs” that he gives each patient! You will not receive quality care from Dr. Danish, Dr. Farner or anyone on his staff. Awful experience! Dr. Danish treated my mother's Multiple Myeloma. At first, we like him as he seemed quite compassionate and knowledgeable. After a few months, he never provided an honest, long term prognosis. He continuously gave my family hope, when, my mom's family doctor told us that my mom's cancer was very aggressive and she would not live long. It was a nightmare! His office and staff is very disorganized and we repeatedly had to contact them to correct their errors. The wait time to see Dr. Danish was usually over one hour. This was disturbing as my mother was very very sick. I would not recommend Dr. Danish as an oncologist to a friend or relative, and actually, would not recommend him to the few people in my life that I am not that fond of. Dr Danish treated my disease as cancer, but it is NOT. He knew the proper treatment and when I received my records from him, it noted, ‘if chemo didn’t work, suggest HIPEC, ‘

We were not impressed. I do NOT recommend that anyone go to Dr. Danish! He is arrogant and condescending. He thinks nothing of making very ill patients wait over 2 hrs. and makes no apologies. He is indecisive with his treatment plans, provides no follow up care between visits and overall leaves his patients feeling confused. He does NOT respond well to questions from patients or their family members and doesn't explain his treatment process. He has taken on too many patients and you are truly treated like a number by him and his office staff. Because of his incompetence, he caused 2 long ICU hospitalizations that were unnecessary due to his inability of use proper follow up care. Don't be fooled by his “hugs” that he gives each patient! You will not receive quality care from Dr. Danish, Dr. Farner or anyone on his staff. Awful experience! Dr. Danish treated my mother's Multiple Myeloma. At first, we like him as he seemed quite compassionate and knowledgeable. After a few months, he never provided an honest, long term prognosis. He continuously gave my family hope, when, my mom's family doctor told us that my mom's cancer was very aggressive and she would not live long. It was a nightmare! His office and staff is very disorganized and we repeatedly had to contact them to correct their errors. The wait time to see Dr. Danish was usually over one hour. This was disturbing as my mother was very very sick. I would not recommend Dr. Danish as an oncologist to a friend or relative, and actually, would not recommend him to the few people in my life that I am not that fond of.","If you value your life I implore go somewhere else!

He has been extremely helpful in guiding me through my journy through cancer. I've been to 3 other doctors the area and none compares to him. Very nice man, very good at keeping me informed on all my treatment Dr. Danish seemed standoffish at first, but when I became extremely ill, he was right there attending to my every need and made all the right decisions. Dr. Danish did not mind when I got an second opinion, he welcomed it. I still stuck with him and he literally saved my life with chemotherapy treatment for my stage 3 breast cancer. He is honest, and to the point, and does not sugar coat anything. He is compassionate and always gives plenty of hugs. He answers all your questions even though he has tons of other patients. If you have cancer of any kind, Dr. Danish will go the extra mile to do everything to save your life like he did man. He is a great man. Dr. Danish is so caring when you are in need of care and compassion. He helps guide you through the most difficult time of your life.

153,Dr. Robert G. Watkins IV,Illinois,physician and surgeon license current probation extended for a minimum of two years with conditions, Male,4.92,,"Dr. Watkins did a ACDF for my cervical stenosis in March, 2013. I had put off surgery for my stenosis for years, knowing it would entail delicate work near the spinal cord. I have a fairly good handle on who is a good surgeon since I have defended many of them in med. malpractice cases and worked with them defending large corporations sued in personal injury cases . Dr. Watkins in my view is one of the great spine surgeons in the U.S. He explained the risks of delaying my surgery and between what he explained and the info on his web site I knew well what the ACDF entailed. I am now making a good recovery. He will promptly answer you e-mails if you have questions between your follow up visits. Note he takes Medicare but I don't think he takes other insurance. I saw Dr Robert Watkins, Jr. & will be scheduling back surgery soon. He is knowledgeable, professional, & I would highly recommend all the Drs. at Watkins Spine (..com). Many great professional athletes have been successfullysurgically treated by the DRS. there, & are still playing their chosen sports. Best Orthopedic DRS. in So. CA! I am medical professor and I have sought the advice of many LA surgeons before selecting the Watkins Spine Clinic. There is no better surgical spine care in Los Angeles and, as was my case, they often repair the mistakes of other less experienced surgeons. You would be lucky to get into this clinic, especially if you need specialized care and the latest techniques. Patients across the country and beyond, both professional athletes and others, seek their care with Dr. Watkins. Likewise all diagnostic and supportive care is superb. Dr. Watkins Jr. did my artificial disc replacement in 2007. I chose him after seven, highly respected surgeons, couldn't help me or wanted to fuse my back. Dr. Watkins is knowledgeable, kind, personable and always spends enough time with me that I leave feeling heard and satisfied with the appointment. He has had to deal with the horrible work comp restrictions I'm under but still manages to get me what I need. I'm a police officer and tell all my friends and co-workers to go to Dr. Watkins. I live in Riverside County but gladly drive to Marina del Rey to see him. I trust him with my life and my livelihood. He has the confidence needed in a great surgeon but not the outrageous ego that make some surgeons unapproachable and inflexible. I have gone to Dr. Watkins Jr. about 6 years ago and he saved my life. In my first visit he informed me of the diagnosis and after I had my sugary I have been 100% pain free. I have recommended Dr. Watkins Jr. to many people with all spine complications and every single one of then are 100% satisfied with his diagnosis and surgery. Over all I trust Dr. Watkins Jr. with my life. I had a laminectomy of L2 L3 in 2010, by Doctor Watkins,followed by a L4 L5 S1 Fusion in March of 2012. The Laminectomy was successfull in removing the pain completely! In 2012 the fusion was needed because of the over use of the disc. After the Laminectomy had healed I was swimming 1 1/2 miles per day.. I think I over did it to the lower discs that were already on edge.. Dr Watkins was very professional and I feel as he is a friend at this point.. He gave me his email address as well as his Cell phone. He has never ignored a call and is always caring. I refer this Doctor to all. Good luck!!

With all of the complaints about the staff that I've seen on this site, I am very surprised that she is still employed. Rude, disorganized staff. He tends to run late. It took 3 phone calls to get lab results 2 weeks after I had the blood tests. Not the best bedside manner. I had switched from another doctor who had retired, and was on long term medication. Dr. Wolf made me come back after just seeing him the month before in order to get a refill and he only gave me two months. Now he wants to charge $300 extra dollars a year from your pocket for 'better service'. See his website. It is there. Shouldn't you get 'better service' anyway? Why be a doctor if you don't want to give good service? I've seen Robert Wolf on two occasions the first one I was met with a $50 missed appointment fee because his staff is incompetent. The second time was to look over a sprained ankle wherein he ordered X-rays on Tuesday. The radiologist sent him the images and report later than day. I called Wednesday and was told Dr Wolf was gone but he'd get back to me. BY FRIDAY EVENING he got back to me to tell me I had a fracture. Wolf is the worst ""doctor"" I ever had the misfortune to encounter. Down to cases: 3+ WEEKS to call in a refill! He was late 1-2 hours EVERY TIME I had an appointment! Constantly makes inappropriate jokes about medical conditions! During my 3 years with him, I had three fairly minor, but annoying health issues. In each case it took 9 mos. to 1 year for him to decide what to do, and each time he had to reverse the decision when it didn't work! I FINALLY LEFT! If I weren't a fairly healthy, middle-age person, I would have left after the first visit. The staff are disorganized, unhelpful, and incompetent. They are constantly looking for misplaced records, or calling patients to cancel or postpone appointments! Seems to be trended toward seniors and ALWAYS had a medical student with him. Nice guy, but had me on prescriptions that did not help and was cautious to take me off.","Excellent Doctor. He is one of the best I’ve seen. I've been seeing him for a few years. As a healthcare professional myself, I can attest that he is an excellent clinician, knowledfeable and takes plenty of time during appointments. Easy to talk to and responsive to emailed questions. Supposedly taking care of mom-n-law. Twice he or his staff gave her antibiotc for a viral infection & the antibiotic was contraindicated with her heart meds. She needs antiviral not antibiotic!!! Malpractice quack. Where to start: His receptionist is an annoying black woman, who is very rude on the phone and in person. 2nd, I was charged 50 bucks for a missed appointment due to her incompetence. 3rd, scheduling a physical with him takes 3 months. 4th, Dr. Wolf isn't very thorough with his exams. Not a lot of preventative care or advice. He said the size of my blood cells was small and needed more lab work. I asked is it possible that it's because I donate blood. His answer? I don't know. Fine, maybe you don't know, but shouldn't you research it and get back to your patient? Nice person, but overall not a good doctor. Plenty of better options. I highly recommend Dr. Wolf. He impressed me by diagnosing my husband's condition in 2 visits (even though our former physician couldn't figure it out in 2 years!) Dr. Wolf got my husband off of unnecessary medicines and referred him to an excellent specialist. I owe my current happy home life to Dr. Wolf. He also is up-to-date with easy computer refills and records, and he gives great preventative care to both of us. I went to see doctor Wolf after my previous physician left the area at his office in Skokie. His office staff was not very professional over the phone, but I bit my lip and showed up at the appointment. It was jammed with my previous physician's patients. When I finally saw the doctor he appeared to be more interested in telling me about himself than my symptoms. I guess next appointment we would have talked about my symptoms. I let him run a blood test. You are required to call a number and get the results on a voice mail system. He said one of my tests was ""weird"". Great, I have a weird test. Needless to say, I flipped out and found another doctor ASAP. This guy's a real joke! I've seen him 4 times and we still haven't discussed ANY of my on-going symptoms. He's always late, always rushes his patients, I've seen patients leave his waiting room because they're tired of waiting. When your appointment is over the front desk gives you (at least they're supposed to; usually have to ask for it)a report/synopsis of what was done/discussed during your appointment. I should be so lucky to have had all these things discussed or done during my appointment as described on his exit report! I'm lucky to have 5 mins. with him. My last appointment I showed up at his office and there was a sign on the door stating that he was no longer at that address and it gave another address! A letter was never received letting me know he was moving. I had to rush to get to the new office on time for my appointment. Not easy when you don't know a thing about the area. I certainly don't feel confident and secure with him; he has no credibility with me.",5.0,7.0,12,  personable enough front desk receptionist without exception rude unfriendly telephone person complaint staff ive seen site surprised still employed rude disorganized staff tends run late took 3 phone call get lab result 2 week blood test best bedside manner switched another doctor retired long term medication   made come back seeing month order get refill gave two month want charge 300 extra dollar year pocket better service see website shouldnt get better service anyway doctor dont want give good service ive seen   two occasion first one met 50 missed appointment fee staff incompetent second time look sprained ankle wherein ordered xrays tuesday radiologist sent image report later day called wednesday told   gone hed get back friday evening got back tell fracture  worst doctor ever misfortune encounter case 3 week call refill late 12 hour every time appointment constantly make inappropriate oke medical condition 3 year three fairly minor annoying health issue case took 9 mo 1 year decide time reverse decision didnt work finally left werent fairly healthy middleage person would left first visit staff disorganized unhelpful incompetent constantly looking misplaced record calling patient cancel postpone appointment seems trended toward senior always medical student nice guy prescription help cautious take,excellent doctor one best ive seen ive seeing year healthcare professional attest excellent clinician knowledfeable take plenty time appointment easy talk responsive emailed question supposedly taking care momnlaw twice staff gave antibiotc viral infection antibiotic contraindicated heart med need antiviral antibiotic malpractice quack start receptionist annoying black woman rude phone person 2nd charged 50 buck missed appointment due incompetence 3rd scheduling physical take 3 month 4th   isnt thorough exam lot preventative care advice said size blood cell small needed lab work asked possible donate blood answer dont know fine maybe dont know shouldnt research get back patient nice person overall good doctor plenty better option highly recommend   impressed diagnosing husband condition 2 visit even though former physician couldnt figure 2 year   got husband unnecessary medicine referred excellent specialist owe current happy home life   also uptodate easy computer refill record give great preventative care u went see doctor  previous physician left area office skokie office staff professional phone bit lip showed appointment ammed previous physician patient finally saw doctor appeared interested telling symptom guess next appointment would talked symptom let run blood test required call number get result voice mail system said one test weird great weird test needle say flipped found another doctor asap guy real oke ive seen 4 time still havent discussed ongoing symptom he always late always rush patient ive seen patient leave waiting room theyre tired waiting appointment front desk give least theyre supposed usually ask ita reportsynopsis donediscussed appointment lucky thing discussed done appointment described exit report im lucky 5 min last appointment showed office sign door stating longer adess gave another adess letter never received letting know moving rush get new office time appointment easy dont know thing area certainly dont feel confident secure credibility,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,1,1,1,0,0

Unfortunately, he was not very good at getting me off the medicines I was on, even though they were making me worse because they were interacting with each other. After a few years, I got another doctor who was able to straighten things out since he couldn't. So, on the plus side, he is a doctor who will listen to you rather than rush you out after 10 minutes. On the negative side, he was definitely not helpful to me so there are better doctors out there.","Dr. Kulkarni is amazing!! I have gone to him for years. He is all about mental wellness & making you well with the most minimum rx's. The reason a new patient may not be able to get an appt. is because he is that good! Get on his waitlist for new patients or go to someone else. By the way, all great doctors do the same thing because they are busy with the patients that they have & do not want to compromise the treatment of the patients they have, by taking on too many new patients. This should say a lot of his integrity, not about the money. Leaving a bad review bc of this, is simply not fair, especially a dr. you have never been to. Many many kudos to Dr. K & his wonderful staff. They are the best! terrific caring brilliant man ive seen for 20 years After years of horrible doctor experiences, I met with Dr. Kulkarni and he was compassionate, compentant and encouraging. He understood what I had been through and gave me a plan on how to get better. It was so refreshing to see a doctor who listened, understood and wants to help. He is very caring, compassionate and gives plenty of time for each patient. He is not one of the kind who just practise medicine for money.He could fix my son's problem in few months. Amazing Doctor.Very knowledgeable. Dr. Kulkarni is really the best Dr. I have ever been to. He listens, understands & his goal is to NOT have his patients on meds unless necessary & to get them off as soon as possible.

156,Dr. Robert P. Radin,California,Continuing Education, Male,2.52,"I had a truly terrible experience with Dr. Radin, and regret having ever visited his office. He is rude, condescending, and unprofessional. His billing practices are questionable, and he is simply not a compassionate provider. Dr. Radin is possibly the most arrogant, condescending man I have ever met. He tried to end my hour-long appointment after only 15 minutes one time. When I try to talk to him about any issue whatsoever he makes rude remarks and laughs. He complains to me every single time we talk about how much he hates my insurance and how grateful I should be that he is willing to talk to me. 

I am desperately looking for another psychiatrist who will accept my insurance. I get such bad anxiety about going to his office but I have to for my prescription. Dr. Radin is very greedy and not at all about caring for patients. I had the worst experience seeing him and really regret trusting him. Dr. Radin charged me $25 per call to my insurance company, something that's in his job description. This ON TOP of my insurance deductible. I owed him well over $150 after my SECOND visit. Awful. Doesn't return calls, never emails when he says he will, and he's rude. Just rude. VDHP is going to have a field day with this guy. I have never met a more arrogant, condescending psychiatrist, he is very abrupt, blunt and rude. He has no people skills or compassion, how can this man be in the business of helping people with mental and emotional issues. He is very impatient and he asked me whether I was slow mentally, that is that I was stupid?!!! I have never been so insulted. I also had to cancel our appointment, 72 hours in advance, he called me back to say he doesnt allow cancellations, that he is not a clinic. I am glad to say I will not see him again and do not recommend him to anyone needing a compassionate doctor. Only chose him because he was the only available dr able to see me within two weeks, now I know why? He should be out of business with his attitudes I wasted a lot of my very hard earned money visiting this man. He is probably in my top five of the most rude, insensitive, condescending, arrogant, disrespectful and down right nasty people I have ever encountered. It's a true shame this man is a doctor that is in the business of ""helping"" people. He didn't help me at all and simply took all of my money. He only accepts cash and is a nightmare when it comes to handling insurance. I ended up paying for 2 visits out of pocket because of his incompetence handling insurance. Many of my paid visits were spent sorting out insurance and payment matters with 5 minutes of talk time left over. On numerous occasions he would even call me names. On the last occasion this occurred I simply got up and walked out in the middle of his sentence. He did nothing for me except waste my time and money. I was nothing but respectful, open, and honest to this man; in search of some help. He couldn't have been any more rude and nasty with me. He is extremely knowledgeable, but also incredibly arrogant and condescending. He was extremely close to where I live which is why I chose him initially, but after seeing him four times I decided I had no rapport with him, and he couldn't help me. He doesn't seem to care much for developing a trusting relationship with his patients, and is almost confrontational when it comes to getting information. He has no secretary and doesn't take credit card which in and of itself is not a big deal, but he is almost completely apathetic when it comes to helping you file your insurance. If you have a very straightforward problem with a straightforward solution he may be able to help you, but if you need to develop a relationship with your doctor to deal with an ongoing illness, this just isn't your guy.

With his skills and experience, he is able to hone in on the true cause of the patient's distress, something that previous therapists have missed. When meds are needed, he will prescribe them with great care and will follow up continually, always listening to the patient's feedback. Thanks to his therapy, my life has been transformed. While I initially thought he was a fine Psych (if just not for me) recent behavior around reimbursement checks from Insurance and attempting to take extra money from them has made me reconsider whether his priorities are really with the patients. Dr. Radin is highly professional, empathetic and perceptive. He sees beyond the obvious and helps me to realize what was previously unknown to me. He is also very knowledgeable about medications. I think Dr. Radin is mis-understood. I've been seeing him for 5 years now and can see while some may find him a bit cold at first. I personally like to challenge him and be challenged by his perspective on things. I think a lot of doctors in this field will simply follow a formulaic approach while he is blunt and attempts to get to the bottom of issues. It does take a bit of self-confidence to work with him, but once you get past his mannerisms, he can be extremely helpful and will research things and work with you to find solid solutions. Very knowledgable in his field and someone you can be quite frank with and even directly question his own analysis. He is not always spot on with his assessments, but is willing to put his ego aside when you challenge him, and quite frankly, bring out the best of what he has to offer. Wow. I called to schedule an appointment as a new patient who just moved to the state. I explained that I found his name through my insurance company, and he informed me I must be wrong because he had never heard of them. Then he said ""I don't have time to talk to you anyway"" and hung up on me. Incredibly rude. Suppose it's for the best, as I can't exactly see myself opening up to someone so insensitive about my psychological issues. I can only imagine how he must treat his patients. I don't understand the negative reviews...I've seen over 5 different psychiatrists for my (serious, but treatable) mental condition over the years, and he is by far the best. He can be a bit gruff over the phone, but is friendly and kind in his office. I believe that he is extremely knowledgeable; also, according to the framed diploma in his office he went to Cornell. Dr. Radin even discussed my case with other psychiatrists in an attempt to determine my diagnosis (strangely, even after all these years, it's not clear what my exact diagnosis is.) Finally, this may sound odd, but he has had a way of making me think positively about my strengths. I feel that his tendency to highlight my good qualities is helpful both in establishing rapport and in improving my self-esteem. I'm sure that sounds odd, but I think it really is important for any psychiatrist to be kind, positive, and competent. Dr. Radin has been all of these things.

158,Dr. Roger A. MacDuff,Illinois,physician and surgeon license suspended for failure to file and/or pay Illinois state income taxes., Male,4.29,"I had very bad experience with this doctor. He smiles to you all the time, however, he does not really care about you. He often forget to give you the lab orders or to change your prescription. I will not recommend this doctor.","I have had 5 different doctors. After a few miscarriages I decided to look for the best Dr. in IL. I met with Dr. Macduff once who referred me to a specialist. He was nice during that visit. After learning I was pregnant, I tried to schedule an appointment with him and thats when the nightmare started. The nurses were no help and I was told making an appointment with him was not ""how it worked"". With a high risk pregnancy, they ended up not seeing me based on the decision of a Dr. who was not my Dr. in first place. I would not recommend this office especially if you are looking for a Dr. and staff who care about you and don't see you just as another number. Dr. MacDuff is wonderful and if it wasn't for the other horrible doctors and front desk staff I would still be at his practice. My husband and I loved seeing Dr. MacDuff throughout my pregnancy and looked forward to seeing him with our next. However; when we found out we were expecting again they couldn't get us in until well into our first trimester. The office staff didn't care that I was concerned. He took his time with his patients which is probably why he was always behind. Its a shame that they run the office the way they do because he is a wonderful doctor but not worth the hassle. Dr. MacDuff cared for for many years. He always took his time to go through my medical history, answer all my questions and concerns. He performed my myomectomy under very stressful conditions when storm came through and power went off. Generators failed as well. All during my surgery. He kept my family informed and calmed them down. 3 years later he delivered my daughter via c-section. I couldn't ask for a better doctor. When we moved o a different state I was very anxious that I won't be able to such good doctor. I highly recommend Dr. MacDuff. Doctor MacDuff is my,current Doctor and he really is great. He takes his time and educate on the problem gives you as many options as he can.if something is wrong he is there to fix it, ive been lucky to have him as my Doctor. Ive had surgery with him and he was the first face I saw the next morning ,this is not just a job to him he really cares !!! Doctor MacDuff is AMAZING. If anyone has had a colposcopy before they can be nervewracking and painful. Dr. MacDuff is the only doctor in my experience who completed the procedure without causing ANY pain. He educates his patients very well. Excellent Doctor! with overwhelming patient loads, patience is something you rarely find in a Doctor any more and I believe he is one in a million. Dr. MacDuff delivered my daughter. He is always helpful and personable. I wish I was able to see him for every on of my visits. I have had some severe health issues over the last 5 years. Dr. MacDuff has worked with me to find the right treatment plan. He is always very thorough. He takes the time to explain to me what all of my options are; as well as review all of the pros/cons for these options. He makes me feel comfortable and is never too busy to answer my questions. I have referred him to several friends and family and will definitely refer him to the others in the future. Dr. MacDuff is great, like the other reviewers he is through, patient, and funny. He makes me feel at ease and he makes the exams much less nervewracking. I ask many questions and he is not at all bothered by them, and takes the time to explain the answers in full detail. I do wish he followed up more, but I'm sure just like any doctor, they are very busy and he is doing his best. Besides I actually do the following up, which is what one should do anyway, and not wait for someone to follow up for you. I would recommend him to anyone. I had Dr MacDuff during my first pregnancy(high risk) and he was during delivery. He is the most wonderful doctor I've ever met. So patient, calm and explains everything. He doesn't rush and I felt confident having him as my doctor. Amazing person:) Dr. MacDuff is FANTASTIC! He is very thorough and answers all your questions. His bedside manner is exceptionally calm and caring. I would highly recommend him! Dr. MacDuff was my OB/GYN during my second pregnancy and also delivered my child. He is wonderful - - the best doctor I've ever had, in any speciality, in my entire life. He takes time with his patients and you never feel as if he is rushing you. He asks plenty of questions and is very thorough. He is gentle and puts you at ease during exams. He never makes you feel uncomforable and provides a high level of care. I highly recommend Dr. MacDuff as an OB/GYN to women in the Elmhurst/Lombard area.",1.0,11.0,12,bd experience doctor smile time however relly cre often forget give lb order chnge prescription recommend doctor,5 different doctor miscrrige decided look best  il met  mcduff referred specilist nice visit lerning pregnnt tried schedule ppointment thts nightmre strted nurse help told mking ppointment worked high risk pregnncy ended seeing bsed decision   first plce would recommend office especilly looking  stff cre dont see nother number  mcduff wonderful wsnt horrible doctor front desk stff would still prctice husbnd loved seeing  mcduff throughout pregnncy looked forwrd seeing next however found expecting couldnt get u well first trimester office stff didnt cre concerned took time ptient probbly lwys behind shme run office wy wonderful doctor worth hssle  mcduff cred mny yer lwys took time go medicl history nswer question concern performed myomectomy stressful condition storm cme power went genertor filed well surgery kept fmily informed clmed 3 yer lter delivered dughter vi csection couldnt sk better doctor moved different stte nxious wont ble good doctor highly recommend  mcduff doctor mcduff mycurrent doctor relly gret tke time educte problem give mny option cnif something wrong fix ive lucky doctor ive surgery first fce sw next morning job relly cre doctor mcduff mzing nyone colposcopy nervewrcking pinful  mcduff doctor experience completed procedure without cusing pin eductes ptient well excellent doctor overwhelming ptient lod ptience something rrely find doctor believe one million  mcduff delivered dughter lwys helpful personble wish ble see every visit severe helth issue lst 5 yer  mcduff worked find right tretment pln lwys thorough tke time explin option well review proscons option mke feel comfortble never busy nswer question referred severl friend fmily definitely refer others future  mcduff gret like reviewer ptient funny mke feel ese mke exm much le nervewrcking sk mny question bothered tke time explin nswer full detil wish followed im sure like doctor busy best besides ctully following one nywy wit someone follow would recommend nyone  mcduff first pregnncyhigh risk delivery wonderful doctor ive ever met ptient clm explins everything doesnt rush felt confident doctor mzing person  mcduff fntstic thorough nswer question bedside mnner exceptionlly clm cring would highly recommend  mcduff obgyn second pregnncy lso delivered child wonderful best doctor ive ever specility entire life tke time ptient never feel rushing sks plenty question thorough gentle put ese exm never mke feel uncomforble provides high level cre highly recommend  mcduff obgyn womn elmhurstlombrd re,1.56e-05,6.11e-06,0.000324049,0.001897671,0.002078754,0.124567979,0.121598837,0.0358,0.999999,0.999999,3.94e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.857,1,0,0,0,0

165,Dr. Scott David Glazer,Illinois,"physician and surgeon license reprimanded, must complete CME's and fined $5,000 for permitting certain non-physician employees to perform Botox injections on patients where respondent was not present to supervise.", Male,3.37,"Upon calling 847.459.6611 to make a new patient appointment I was ""greeted"" by a very rude woman. My call was an obvious inconvenience to her and when I pointed that out, she hung up on me. Needless to say I will be contacting another dermatologist. I hope the Dr. himself or an office manager monitors these reviews. The call to the aforementioned number was made 2/13/16 at 10:04am. On a normal day, he comes off as uncaring and a pompous ass. When I thought that ran out of medicaton one day early, he then turned 100% unprofessional even yelling at me in his office to a point where I was crying. He actually said ""I don't trust you now"". Long story short? Do NOT use this doctor! He has no bedside manner, extremely unprofessional and has no compassion! very knowledgeable, but seems to have little time to explain diagnosis or procedures.","I've always been pleased with Dr. Glazer's manner, knowledge, and staff. In my experience, he's always been punctual. I have gone to Dr. Glazer for many years and have referred him to many people. He is just an outstanding dermatologist. Always fixes the problem. Not an alarmist and very low key. Very knowledgeable. Simply the best! This doctor triple books his appointments. He is always about 40 minutes late and give about 2 minutes to a patient. He runs his practice like a doctor factory and can easily miss a critical symptom. Next time I'll go to a doctor that cares about his patients and not just the volume he can run through his office in a day. In my opinion, He's a malpractice situation waiting to happen. Love him... I've been seeing him since I was little to have my moles checked out. My husband and kids also see him. He gives me his time. I never feel like I'm being rushed out. When it comes to skin I don't think there is anything he can't do. I started seeing Dr. Glazer in the early 80s.He is the best.Today I travel over an hour to go see him, but he`s well worth the drive!! Always helpful in explaining, always very little wait. Really and truly, the TOPS in his field. Best there is. The whole practice is great. I've been going to Dr Glazer since the early 90's and found him to be tops in his field. His medicinal cream (purchased at his office) beats anything at the pharmacy, and his technique for treatment of my skin disorder was far more creative than any other doctor had demonstrated. My daughter has reported good results after being treated by him for her facial acne. Best dermatologist in Chgoland. I have gone to Dr. Glazer for years. I think he is the greatest. he has helped me so much, always taking the time to listen - I have receommended many people to him and they love him too. I have a skin condition, hello, he wouldn't even look me in the face much less my skin. He said that my condition was not cureable and that I should try some of the free samples that the receptionist would give me, plus his own preparation which I had to pay for. I will never go back there again. I went to another dermatologist that was not on my HMO and she spent an hour with me looking at my skin, and scalp and discussing treatment plans.

Found out his office wasn't sending Rx to CPAP supplies provider so now I know why they were so eager to fill my supplies. Constant appts via video/phone required (which were no shows on their part so I fired him) when should have been 1x per yr. I was having terrible headaches and my former doctor couldn't do anything for me to stop the pain. When I changed doctors and started going to Dr. Jochims he put me on Topiramate and ever since I have not have a single headache like I had before. A difference of day to night. ldn't do anything for me Dr. Jochims helped my foot pain, put me on a drug that helped a lot. He also sent me to physical therapy for my back pain, the exercises relieved the pain. As long as I don't get lazy and keep doing them. So my experience was great with Dr. Jochims Dr. Jochims has monitored my use of the Resmed device since I was diagnosed at the Prohealth Sleep Center. He has been very consistent about my improvement using the device. At first it looked like I was going to have no problem using it. Eventually I found it very difficult to match my sleep habits such as position with sleeping on my back.. Eventually, he advised a different nose appliance, which led to less fewer air leaks and fewer times that I awakened during use. He has been very diligent about refining my benefits because I have serious apnea issues. He prescribed a medicine (muscle relaxer) to help with the sciatic pain I experience from sleeping on my back due to chronic lumbar problems. Dr. Jochims is an attentive listener and has a gentle manner.","He is very knowable. Has insights beyond what other doctors were unable to help me with. Very personable. Had met him several times, but recently started seeing him. Only 2 appointments in, he left medical practice. What is explained to patients is he is now on permanent leave of absence due to health concerns and has closed his medical office. Very concerned it is something that can be dealt with and never gets too disabling (what ever it is, or whichever family member it involves). Holding him and his family in prayer, for the strength to handle whatever it might be. Always a pleasure coming here. The entire staff and providers are so committed to their patients. From getting me wheelchair and helping me get my father in to the office to getting him comfortable and warm for his testing. Getting an appointment on very short notice is always very accomadated. I refer as often as possible and we are so happy we found such a caring Doctor and office for my fathers neurological and many health needs! Thank you all countless times! I started with serious sleep apnia. 49 interruptions per hour. The ResMed unit is easy to use. Most nights the interruption average is only 2-3, sometimes a little higher. I sleep deeply for the night. The best part is I’m awake and alert during the whole day. No danger driving. Thank you to Dr. Jochims and the excellent staff. Everyone was helpful, and took the time necessary to answer any questions. I have had great success with Dr. Jochims. The pain in my feet has improved since being on the meds he perscribed. Also my back pain has improved since he sent me to Physical Therapy. They gave me exercises to do that have improved the pain. I am feeling much better. Dr Jochims understood my tremor condition and was able to eliminate parkinson's disease. We started a medication treatment but went slowly until we found the dosage that works for me. He listens to what I'm telling him so we can discuss options. Dr Jochims has a very calming personality and I feel that I have an excellent partner in my medical needs. I have been with Dr. Jochims for many years now & continue to be very happy with him & his staff. I have a follow up appointment with Dr. Jochims yearly. Had an wonderful experience with this clinic, Dr. Jochims was so very kind even though I tend to talk a lot when I’m nervous :) he really put me at ease. It’s a very frustrating thing feeling symptoms so profound and not knowing the cause , he listened and was very sympathetic to it. I would highly recommend not only this clinic but also Dr. Jochims to anyone!! ""I was very pleased with my experience and care with Dr. Sean Jochims and his staff! It was good to be treated with professionalism and care. I definitely would recommend Dr. Sean Jochims, Neurologist, as he is the best! Thank you! Diana We are very happy with the care we get from Dr. Jochims. He cares about his patients and makes the time to listen to their needs. We would highly recommend him. Absolutely a great practice, Dr. Jochims and his staff fit me in their schedule, I was having a right knee replacement and at the last minute I needed a sleep study, and Dr. Jochims fit me in and did the sleep study and everything that goes along with the sleep study so I didn’t have to change my surgery date by over a month later. His staff even came in early one morning (Before Office Hours) to go over the sleep study results with me. Appointments are always on time. His staff is excellent and very helpful. Dr. Jochims takes time to answer my questions and any concerns. I never feel he is rushing to the patient. The quality of his care and concern for my wellness is always evident. Friendly and helpful staff, from the initial contact all the way through the appointment. The time with Dr. Jochims was very helpful and informative; he made recommendations for lifestyle changes and his demeanor is such that one does not feel rushed; his ""bedside manner"" is excellent! I am always impressed with the staff here and the care and attention I receive. Dr. Jochims is very thorough and kind and takes the time to listen to my concerns and if appropriate, will suggest different medications or treatment options. Restless Leg Syndrome is something I have struggled with for many years, but I feel that I have finally found a physician who knows a great deal about this disorder and the various options for treatment and alleviation of discomfort. Shannon, Dr. Jochim's assistant is a joy -- she makes a visit fun, and we always enjoy a laugh together. I have never had to wait more than a few minutes before any appointment, and check-in is fast and easy. The staff is attentive and mindful of their patients' time and other commitments. I am very thankful to have found the Neurological Wellness Center. Thank you!! Dr Jochims and the other staff gave me a lot of information and listened to everything I said. They were very prompt and nice. My follow up appointments have been easy to schedule, on time, and efficient. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Very helpful understanding what is going on. They took care of my needs faster than I expected to meet my other scheduled appointment. Both Kristin and dr jochims are Comfortable to talk to, and I would advise other people to go there. Dr. Jochims was on time, and the nurse was efficient and asked all the right questions. Dr. Jochims listened to what I had to say and came up with a simple solution to my problem. From the time I walked in the door, I received excellent service, from everyone in the department I encountered. Thank you My treatment was thorough and fast. My sleep is much improved. Dr Jochims got me the proper treatment the first try. Total staff is very friendly and helpful. Wait time was minimal. All of my questions were answered. Very professional and courteous team. Answers any questions I had and took the time I needed to understand all that was involved with sleep apnea Dr. Joachims was great. He was very friendly and made everything as possible as possible. I received results right away and the referral to my hand specialist was very quick. Dr. Jochims was running a bit late, and after maybe 10 minutes, the receptionist offered to have me see the NP. My case is really easy, just restless leg syndrome, so I agreed. I felt she was very nice, extremely competent and I was very satisfied with the care I received. I referred my brother-in-law, who had a severe problem, to Dr. Jochims. Dr. Jochims, while unable to do the surgery my brother-in-law needed, was able to get the proper surgeon in a very short amount of time. He was the only physician my brother-in-law had seen (and there were 2 or 3) that actually helped. I'm more than happy to refer Dr. Jochims to anyone who needs a neurologist or a sleep specialist. you could not ask for better staff members are also friendly and caring . I have been a patient of Dr. Jochims I think since he started this practice I followed him even though he was not in my insurance plan and had to pay full price I have that much faith in him he’s a

Best,Illinois,"physician and surgeon license reprimanded, must complete 20 CME's, and fined $10,000 due to a breach of his fiduciary duties to the members of the retirement plan that he was responsible to administer and/or maintain.", Male,3.14,"Terrible experience with this doctor. He made things worse and wasted time and money. If you have had a terrible experience with him too please go to the idpfr web site and file a report as I have done. It keeps the reporter anonymous. This guy has already had his license reprimanded before. He also has a couple legal problems with the state and US department of labor. Guy is bad news. If I knew what I know now I never would have set foot in his office. Do not ever go to this man. You will regret it. If I could rate him a negative 10 I would. He destroyed my marriage and family. My mentally ill wife was seeing him for treatment. When my kids were acting up he convinced her he was a family counselor though he had never been married or had kids. In one hour (the first time I had ever met him) he told us we could no longer be married. He interfered with any reconciliation attempts I offered for the next three years. He advised her to move out--abandoning me and the kids. When I went to see him to discuss this he prescribed antidepressants for me though I was not a patient saying ""anger is a form of depression."" Of course I was angry. He had just advised my wife to move out when we only wanted help dealing with rebellious kids. He is only interested in controlling weak minded people and hooking them on addictive drugs for which they need to see him often at excessive fees. If you have any sense avoid him like the plague! He will ruin your life too! He is bitter from losing a leg in a motorcycle accident and he doesn't want anyone else to be happy. Be careful! Reckless in prescribing a med. that needed to be carefully monitored. I ended up in the hospital with a toxic level (3x the max level). Once that was discovered through a blood test in the hospital, the med. dir. at the hospital would not let him prescribe anything w/o his consent. The fact that he's not affiliated with a hospital should cause you to question why. 

He became enraged at me several times when he thought I didn't do what he wanted me to do. I couldn't believe a doctor was shouting at me. He definitely has an anger problem - google Best v. Best. I liked him at first but after all of this I was scared of him and found someone else. Terrible!!! Didn't help us in fact may have hurt the problem. From we are told by our current doctors -- treatments may have even been not done properly Dr. Best = Dr. Worst. I was worse off after receiving treatment from this doctor. Not a good doctor. judgmental and rude. find a better doctor. I found Dr. Best to be irresponsible with monitoring my child's medication. Inadequate record keeping, not monitoring blood tests, pushing to over-medicate. I would never recommend this doctor or this practice to anyone. Big promises, lots of ""hope"", questionable treatments results, non or very little insurance coverage, no local hospital affiliations, very expensive. not a good doctor... very judgemental. very over priced. gets very angry. wouldnt reccomend at all. Extremely rude, uncaring, expensive. Questionable treatments. Go somewhere else. he is a very patient doctor. hr helped my son when no other doctor could. For someone in the self-help profession, he was quite judgmental, demeaning, tactless and rude. He saved my kids lives; they were misdiagnosed and miserable for two yrs until we met with Dr B! He is very up on the latest diagnostics and treatments.","He should not be practicing. Also why the name change from Steven to Steve on other sites? He can’t actually think it will allow him to hide. This guy is out for one thing….$$. Helpful correction for the October 2020 reviewer: Dr. Best was in fact married at one time. Google Best V Best to find out what he did to her, and what he really is. Dr best is not afraid to try new treatments and do what it takes to get his patients in a better place. I highly recommend. We just did our taxes and I can honestly say, because of the outlandish costs for Dr. Best, I almost received a refund. Sad. We are going to a different doctor now and Dr. Best's reputation proceeds him. He is known as a ""one-trick pony who is out for the $$."" If you are considering using him, consider again. If you want to get better, look no further. If you follow his treatment plan, you get better. It’s that simple. Dr. Best is a highly intelligent psychiatrist that has gone out of his way to treat my clinical depression/anxiety that has haunted me for most of my life. He may have his own opinions about how a treatment should be done right, but he is open to suggestion when it come to alleviating my distress. It is the only practice that I have seen that will treat you like family and I am very thankful for that. Very knowledgeable, after visits with many other doctors, this time someone finally got the diagnosis right and we are on our way to getting better! I have been all over the Midwest and tried every treatment available for CRPS, a chronic treatment resistant pain disease. Nothing worked. Dr. Best put me into remission. He is brilliant! He does not give up or give in. He is focused and dedicated! I have seen him change lives one after another since I have been there. It is amazing. My journey through failed treatments has been blogged online, and this successful journey has been blogged as well. Make no mistake...this clinic is where people come when they are down to two options....try this or jump off of a bridge. This is for the most resistant of treatment resistant. And it works! I owe my life to Dr. Best. This is worth every penny and more. It is not a cure. It is a treatment. I am not ""fixed"" but I am better. I don't have words to express my gratitude. Please feel free to contact me with questions. I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS/RSD) Gracie G Bagosy Dr Best has helped me when nobody else could. I've had chronic depression my entire life and for the first time in I don't know how long, I feel happy. Depression is a nasty disease of mind and body...a systemic disease....and he gets people like me who are treatment resistant....His approach is to heal...not to pacify...He's brilliant and I have much respect for him. He's compassionate, empathetic, knowledgeable and professional. I would totally recommend him and the work he does. He helps a lot of people who are at their wits end. I know from personal experience. Brilliant, fabulous doctor. Dr. Best made correct diagnosis before tests were administered. On most annual visits all my questions are not answered, but makes himself directly available via e-mail (how many M.D.s do this?). Also, gracious demaenor while patient processes. Open to alternative therapies if such treatment seems viable to him. As Dr. Best was recommended to us, our family feels honored to have been under his supervision. Dr. Best and his staff have frequently gone out of their way to care for our child. He is extremely knowledgeable about his field but also an excellent resource for services outside his own office. Over a few years experience with Dr. Best, he's always been incredibly helpful to our family. Diagnosed before testing and was 100% spot-on. Extremely personable yet professional. Absolutely one of the best, to be sure! Would recommend to anyone. very expensive, but he knows his stuff. Uses spec scans to help diagnose and perscribe medication. Don't waste your money.

Trupin,Illinois,physician and surgeon license reprimanded must complete 30 hours of CME's and fined $20000 for negligent administration of lidocaine to a patient., Female,2.97,"Hate calling here. Desperately need better customer service. Dr. spends very little time with patients from my experience. Have not billed my insurance despite asking if they have many times so charges are not being discounted or applied to my deductible. Was billed for a missed appointment that I had cancelled much more than 24 hours in advance. Long waits. Recently switched doctors because too many mistakes/oversights were made. I felt very insecure about her ability/her staff's ability to follow through with treatment procedures and lab work. I just think she has too many patients. I visited her office 6 times in one year and only actually saw Dr. Trupin once. Every visit is at least 2 hours. Dr. seems over obligated and under staffed. Always in a rush, doesn't answer questions and skirts patients concerns. Staff seems to be told not to answer questions but to refer to her. Would not recommend Dr. office if you have or may have any health issues they may not be addressed.","I had to have 5 blood transfusions from a botched hysterectomy with this monster. After having complications, she refused to see me but rather sent her NP in. I got a second opinion who told me that I have been ""butchered on the inside"". Dr Trupin is a rockstar but the woman managing the front desk is pretty dreadful and I will tell you why- she is clearly overworked. Ninety percent of the time, she is the only person at the front desk, checking in and out patients while taking phone calls and dealing with the billing department (absolutely horrendous). The other ten percent of the time, when she has a coworker at the desk with her, it is someone that has no idea what they are doing and have to refer to the main front desk attendant for everything, which simply puts more on the woman's plate instead of helping. I do not mind waiting on a good doctor but the snide remarks and attitude that you have to wade through by the front desk worker is way too thick. I have serious doubts that this woman wants to act that way but there is only so much that one person can manage before cracking. I would probably act like that if it were my work environment as well. The other staff members, such as nurses and phlebotomists, really have their act together, which is a major plus. It is a shame that the front desk is so poor. That is your first interaction with this office and can really make a person seek a new doctor, although I'm sure that might even be a relief to Dr. Trupin since she has so many patients! Smart, knowledgeable, and pulls no punches. Is aware of the latest and most up to date info. Very open to and supportive of second opinions. My daughter was diagnosed for a condition her sister has based on her complexion. Waited over two hours for a procedure. Doctor likes to push cosmetic treatments. Very knowledable on several different topics of health concerns. Overall pleasant experience in the office, nursing staff seemed busy but efficient. Dr Trupin is on the eccentric side, but she is so very knowledgeable. On my initial consult she spend almost an hour with my husband and I explaining my condition and different treatment options.

180,Dr. Syam P. Kunam,California,Sister State Disciplinary Action, Male,2.25,"As the others said, he rarely makes eye contact but if you're taking a controlled substance, that gets his attention! I take medication as prescribed. I was taking another medication that's approved by the FDA for my illness, yet I had to choose which one to take. If I had my illnesses under control, I'd actually thank him for his apathy (not empathy) because of him, I've had to learn about medicine. I'm no doctor, but I can read lab reports, even diagnose quite a few things because of him and others like him I've spent years learning medical terminology. It's not just him, unfortunately, but most doctors where I live.

As far as his knowledge goes, it's actually higher than 1 star, but I only gave him one star because he's too lazy to use his knowledge and do the work a doctor needs to do on a given patient. Diagnosing patients isn't like on TV. You don't go in for 1 or 2 visits, get meds, come back and everything is fine. That said, if he put the work in, maybe work with other doctors to try to find something that could help, I have no doubt progress would be made, but because he's lazy he only gets one star. Hell, if other patients are like me and had his knowledge, people would be getting the help they need! He didn't even look away from his computer to greet me. When he found out I was on Adderall he treated me even more disrespectfully. He said ""All the kids are taking Adderall but someday you probably want to think about getting off of it."" I told him I was 42. Then he said that I was getting too old for Adderall. He said, ""Your fine now but can you imagine a 50 yo taking two speed balls a day?"" He must be getting tired of psychiatry or somethin'. I've never been treated so poorly. Never really talked to my child. I had to ask him all the questions with very little feedback. My son did not click with him at all, he just kept piling on more meds. As the others said, he rarely makes eye contact but if you're taking a controlled substance, that gets his attention! I take medication as prescribed. I was taking another medication that's approved by the FDA for my illness, yet I had to choose which one to take. If I had my illnesses under control, I'd actually thank him for his apathy (not empathy) because of him, I've had to learn about medicine. I'm no doctor, but I can read lab reports, even diagnose quite a few things because of him and others like him I've spent years learning medical terminology. It's not just him, unfortunately, but most doctors where I live.

As far as his knowledge goes, it's actually higher than 1 star, but I only gave him one star because he's too lazy to use his knowledge and do the work a doctor needs to do on a given patient. Diagnosing patients isn't like on TV. You don't go in for 1 or 2 visits, get meds, come back and everything is fine.

181,Dr. Syed Ali,Illinois,"physician and surgeon license placed on indefinite probation for a minimum of one year, with multiple conditions and fined $3,000 due to inappropriately prescribing controlled substances.", Male,3.72,"Dr. is a joke. Didn't listen initially wanted to send me to a different psychiatrist then listened. Was answering phone and texts during consultation. Then said I needed hospiatilization because of depression. Didn't agree and then called paramedics while waiting to leave with the police. Said I threatened to kill myself. All in all he wasn't listening and since I didn't think I needed long term hospital care and said no he did this. Went to the hospital and was released within 1 hour. What a joke His wife is my normal psychiatrist, but I have seen him a few times when she was unavailable. In the hospital, I never trusted that it was ME he was prescribing to because he constantly confused me with another patient; I was 20 and she was 11. When I had massively aversive side effects to geodon (wonky vision, massive panic attacks, inability to sleep, hallucinations), he refused to consider reducing it, wanting me to wait it out until I could see his wife (though he was perfectly happy to increase the dose for me on his own). He just gave me sleeping pills, since the lack of sleep was the most critical side effect.","I have been a patient of Dr. Syed Ali for 6 years. Prior to him, I had seen other ""highly recommended"" psychiatrists for over 10 years. If you are seeking a psychiatric professional who gives his patient the time they need to explain their situation, as well as someone who has the knowledge and deep insights to fully understand how to help you to a path to recovery, THERE IS NO ONE ELSE EVEN CLOSE! Yes, one might have to wait a bit , but that is only because he provides every patient with the time they need. Truly, where does one go today to visit any excellent doctor and not wait for some time beyond their appointment time. When it is your turn, you will be very pleased as you are also being treated with the best there is! To me that is worth the wait, which is by no means excessive. When it comes to your own serious health issues, don't waste years like I did before I found the very best. Call Dr. Ali FIRST, and you won't need anyone else!! LOL this is an UNPAID endorsement. I am in fact PROUD to recommend this wonderful man and renowned practitioner!! Dr. Syed Ali is very knowledgeable, helpful, and professional. Dr. Ali made me feel very comfortable in his office during my entire evaluation. Dr. Ali had even called me on two instances to personally talk with me. Doctor Ali is very busy and runs a little behind, but I recommend the wait is worthwhile. Dr. Ali is a very nice man, but if you care at all about your time, find another doctor. Three appointments in a row, 10 to 20 minutes late every time. When I canceled my final appointment after waiting 15 minutes, he called me and suggested I find another doctor because I valued punctuality and that doesn't work with him. Like I said, very nice, but time is not his strong suit. I feel so grateful to have found such a balanced professional. Very knowledgeable, responsive and compassionate. He listens. And when you call for an appt (even as a new pt) you can be seen in a couple of days. considerate. listens. always looking for what is best for you. I think he is a good doctor.

185,Dr. Thomas A. Heggen,Illinois,physician and surgeon license indefinitely suspended for violation of the Department's Probation., Male,4.65,,"I have been seeing Dr. Heggen for the 3-rd year, and I do like him a lot.
He never poses as a big shot like some doctors but listens to you and answers questions.
He goes along with your requests for certain blood and other tests to clarify and clear up any doubts and suspicions.
Amazingly, he seems to know everything about any element in your blood and its effect on the body and the ways to modify them.
In the past some doctors answered my questions about my blood work like this, ""Let's retest in 3 months,"" - ""but what do you think about these numbers doctor?"" - ""Let's retest,.."" - ""But still what do these numbers mean?"" In 3 month I retested - same results. I called the doctor, ""Doctor, so what's going on?"" - ""Make an appointment and see me"" - ""But I just saw you 3 month ago,"" - ""How am I supposed to make any money?"" (I swear that was Dr. Froderman's reply - Advocate Care in Libertyville). Finally, he did not know what to say, and it ended up in him telling me to find another doctor (easy solution).
Dr. Heggen answered my every question about every element and made recommendations that changed some readings to the best in a short time.
IMO, he is a very good doctor. love him. wish he would come back . always took his time never rushed. really cared about you said Best DR EVER! Miss him! He was amazing. Always listened eas VERY concerned and never rushed! Always checked EVERYTHING!! Dr. Heggen is the most wonderful and patient doctor ever! He spends equal time with all his patients and listens to them. If you are looking to find him he has opened a spa called etrnal med spa in Shorewood, Il. He left Tomasiks practice and is not able to practice with in 25 miles of Tomasiks office. Thats BS if you ask me...HE IS THE BEST DOCTOR EVER!!!! Please post how we can get in touch with Dr. Heggen. Tomasik's office will not give out his current contact info, and I am pregnant and want Heggen or Egan to deliver my baby again, not Tomasik. Heggen had been my doc forever, and he left during my first pregnancy in 2008. Egan delivered my son. Dr. Heggen listens! I had food poison when I was pregnant and he sent me to the hospital right away for being so dehydrated. My sons heart rate kept dropping and an emergency c-section was done. Another doctor did not listen and told me to take medicine that made me more dehydrated. I trust him and Dr. Egan completely. They are a great team! I am happy I went in to the office for a second opinion. I have been treated by Dr Heggen for a couple yrs and he has been THE BEST doctor I have ever gone to. I've needed a hysterectomy for yrs due to ovarian cysts since age 11 and severe endo but didn't trust any of the Drs in the past. He performed my hysterectomy March 2008 at age 44. No pain, no complications. AMAZING! One of the best decisions I've ever made. I have heard so many horror stories. I tell people all the time that I honestly had nearly no pain. Only very faint cramping. Dr Heggen has been nothing but professional, courtious and truly caring. I would...and have...recommended him to many. I would not have had such a procedure done if it were not for him. In my opion, he is the ""best"" doctor. Dr. Heggen is the alltime best Ob/Gyn doctor you could possily find..His knowledge & bed side manner is excellent. If you want a doctor who will treat you like he's known you all his life, he's your man. He will talk to you like you're a family member & give you his own advice. Dr. Heggen delivered my son in 2007 & was so caring & compassionate...Can't say enough about him.. I have been a patient of his for as long as he has been in Joliet...at least 22 years. Followed him from another practice. He did a laproscopic hysterectomy on me last fall. It could have not gone smoother. Very caring. Treats you like you are his family or friend. Very professional care. Have recomended him to many people. I also seee him for non-gynecological care and he is great. Excellent Doc, I've been seein him a little over 29 year Simply the best! I am an ob nurse and have worked with many different physicians over the years, and he is the total package. I've never met anyone who had a negative experience with him. He treats everyone with respect. He has a lot of patience and that is what a great obstetrician needs (many babies are not in a hurry to be born, and some doctors are in a hurry and will do c-sections so they can be done! Dr. Heggen has been my ob/gyn for almost ten years now. He is an incredible doctor; so amazing that I also use him as my general doctor. He has saved my life on two different occassions. On my new patient exam he happened to listen to my lungs and notice an area that turned out to be a serious melanoma. He was concerned to the point that he wouldn't let me leave the office until he removed it. The second occassion he saved my life (and my daughter's) was when he was delivering my child. I had a difficult labor, and my baby's heart rate also dropped sharply. I have a wonderful relationship with Dr. Heggen, and trust his judgement without question. Dr. Heggen is a caring, real doctor. He has a great sense of humor and always speaks to patients without using professional jargon, but also accomplishes this without ""talking down"" to patients. I would never go to another doctor and thank God that I found him, especially since I am VERY picky about who treats me. Saved my life and my unborn child's life. Extremely good physician. Dr. Heggen listens to you and wants to help you. He never seems like he is in a hurry, and treats you with respect. If it wasn't for Dr. Heggen, my daughter and I would not be here.

He is extremely knowledgeable and makes it a point to put his patients at ease when concerns arise. I can't imagine going to anyone else for my healthcare needs. Best doctor I’ve ever seen. His knowledge, professional manner and diagnostic ability are superior. But especially his deep commitment and caring for each patient is incredibly meaningful. I actually look forward to seeing him and knowing I’ll receive the best care and counseling. Staff is great too.. I've been a patient of Dr. Klein's for a number of years now. I'm always impressed by how much he cares about me, personally. I'm not just 'another patient' -- he really treats me with the care of a family member or friend. He is candid and frank in his advise. While he does expect the courses of action he prescribes will be followed, he also knows and works within the limits of an average persons day-to-day life experiences. Regarding his staff... while they do seem to be very laid back, I have never had a problem with an appointment, billing or any other behaviours which would be expected from a professional office. And (believe it or not), they see to be enjoying their jobs! I whole-heartedly recommend Dr. Klein to anyone who is looking for a Dr. who cares. He truly does. Dr. Klein is a fabulous doctor.

192,Dr. Vishal K. Verma,California,Sister State Disciplinary Action, Male,4.5,,"Dr. Verma's rehabilitation treatment after my recent torn ACL has been the best rehab I have ever received. I had gone through several Physical Therapy centers and did not achieve the same results as I did with Dr. Verma. He was very attentive to my needs and customized my therapy to make sure I was getting the proper care and treatment. After a few months of therapy with Dr. Verma, I was able to go hiking/biking and even snowboarding without hesitation. I highly recommend Dr. Verma's care as he is one of the most knowledgeable Chiropractors I have ever met and I have been to several unfortunately. I began seeing Dr. Verma and Eric (his muscle-worker extraordinaire assistant) for back spasms since April’2007. he got me back into tip top shape in about 2 months. Dr. Verma really an expert in this & experienced, wise, kind and helpful. His treatments are non-invasive, gentle and straightforward. The warm electrical stimulation relaxed the knots and spasms in my back so his adjustments could align my back. He doesn't keep me waiting. I would recommend him highly to those suffering chronic back. Dr. Vishal Verma is one of many Chiropractic Physicians that took the time to explain to me what my core issues were and showed me how I could get better to improve my overall health. I suffer from neck and back pain causing severe headaches and nausea. I have seen many Chiropractors my day and Dr. Verma’s therapy plan has been the most effective. He has always projected good bedside manners and I never felt pressured to continue care as other offices had made me feel. I highly recommend Dr. Verma and his wonderful staff. Although his office does not accept insurance, I am reluctant to go elsewhere based on past experience. The professional treatment and care I receive from Dr. Verma is worth every penny. My family and I cannot thank him enough for being a wonderful and caring person. Very bad staff at Natural Horizons Wellness Center. My friend referred me and said he is gonna give me free consultation. They never told me until the end that they dont take any insurance, not even AETNA. Then he gave me 10 minutes treatment and never told me how much it is going to cost. In the end they charged me 205$. I felt cheated.

194,Dr. Wendi G. Marcus,Illinois,physician and surgeon license placed on indefinite probation for a minimum of one year must complete continuing medical education and fined $5000 for improper monitoring of several patients while prescribing controlled substances., Female,2.43,"My experience was very recent and it appears she has not gotten any better. I was in to see her in 2012 specifically to let her know my thyroid area seemed enlarged. This was my first time seeing her and I had not had my thyroid checked before. She touched it and dismissed it almost immediately. The physical was almost non existant. I got my blood taken and she said to take more Vitamin D. Thats it. Was in just this past May 2014 for a physical and let her know that I had been feeling very dizzy everytime I would stand up. I also let her know that I was chewing ice like crazy. I also pointed out my thyroid once again. She did do a palpatation and I did insist that it was getting bigger and she somehwat reluctantly said to have an ultrasound . She said they could do it that day and that she would call me personally if the results were abnormal. Over a week and a half goes by and I get a call from her nurse who said my blood test was normal but that I needed to take Vitamin D. Oh, and at the end she threw in, by the way, the Dr. thinks you need a biopsy on your thyroid because they found a nodule! What? I have never really been ill and just the word biopsy scared the heck out of me. I was thrown for a loop. I tried to ask the nurse questions about the nodule and she could not answer anything. I told her I was disappointed that the Dr. didn't call me back personally as this was bad news and she told me she would call me. She said she would have the Dr. call me. She gave me the name of two endocrinologists in their practice to call to schedule an appt. I told her no thanks. I would find my own because I was so turned off by the Dr.s behavior that I thought everyone in the practice would be the same. I found my own Endo but could not get in for 3 months because I had no details on my nodule or urgency. I called the practice manager and cried and told her how upset I was. Dr. Marcus called me back after two weeks to say it had been crazy. I expressed my frustration and fear and she said in a very snotty way, ""I am sorry you fell that way"". Very cold! I asked her how bit the nodule was and she didn't tell me but said to see if I could get into the Endo in sooner....UGH. I tried to tell the Endo that my dr. said this was urgent. They asked for the results of my Thyroid function test that should be standard for a physical at my age. Turns out Dr. Marcus didn't even request the test. UGH UGH. I finally got into the Endo who was awesome. She listened to my sypmptoms and also said that the nodule on my Thyroid was HUGE and that we now need to surgically remove it to test it for cancer. WHAT!!!! She also ran a standard CBC Blood test. I hopped on a plane that evening for a wedding in Portland Or. The next morning I got a call from my new Endo who was extremely concerned because my Hemoglobin was 7.5. Btw, thats really really low and very dangerious. Funny this didn't even have anything to do with my Thyroid and could have been caught with a regular blood test. I couldn't leave Portland until the reception was over but was scared the entire time that I would have a heart attack. I immediately saw the Oncologist who started me on Iron IV infusions to combat my severe anemia. I have since gotten a new primary care physicial who actually seems to care about my health. She listens to all my symptoms and she communicates with the specialists I am working with. She is great. Very sad and angry that my initial PCP didn't catch something as easy to spot an Anemia which because life threatening. I now have to have surgery to biopsy the nodule which could have been done with a needle had it been caught sooner. My first visit started out by her saying you have 15 minutes...whats up? She clearly has -0- bedside manner and could careless that I was there because I was not feeling well. She should write another cook book and forget being a doctor. Agree with all the above comments. Very cold, rushed, and at times rude. Misdiagnosed a condition and put me through unnecessary testing and prescribed unnecessary medication. When I told her that the medication was making feel worse, she ignored my situation. Dr Marcus has a horrible bedside manor, is unfriendly and seemed uninterested that I'm 45 lbs overweight and have very high cholesterol. I had a physical without getting into a gown. She didn't ask for a urine specimen or do a breast or rectal exam( not that I wanted one). It took 2+ weeks to get results of blood-work.I would NEVER recommend her to anyone. She should be ashamed of herself!!!! Just because you can get into medical school doesn't mean you'll be a good doctor. On a positive note... her staff is very helpful. Unfortunately that's not a reason to stay with a doctor. Rudest, most uncaring medical profession I have ever met. She does not care about her patients, doesn't listen to problems and concerns and is always in a hurry. Luckily, she is not my doctor but was just filling in for my own doctor. I would DIE before EVER USING HER AGAIN! PATIENTS BEWARE THIS DOCTOR SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING. This doctor was completely unhelpful. She took no initiative, was very curt, and totally dismissive.","Dr. Marcus has zero empathy. Her bedside manner is nonexistent. Many times I’ve gone to see her and she’s acted like I was bothering her and she had something better to do. She is not a great listener either. Call me crazy but I believe that doctors should care at least a bit about their patients. I've seen Dr. Wendi Marcus a number of times and was always a bit turned off by her cold demeanor. She seems like she has much better things to be doing instead of treating you. I have since switched to Dr. Ferber at the same practice and he is wonderful. Dr. Marcus was clearly in a hurry when she examined me. The experience was very impersonal, and I felt like she was bothered by some of the questions I asked her. I will not use her services again. Have gone to her for a few years, & she's always kind of had this rushed aura about her, if you are the type of patient that goes in there with your list of questions and you know exactly what you want to get done at that appointment, Dr. Marcus will do you fine. If you're a bit more timid, though, I would try and find someone else. She's a nice enough woman and from what I can surmise a very good doctor, but sometimes she seriously lacks in comforting bedside manner. Many times she seems she has some place else she wants to be other than in the exam room with you making sure that everything's covered. I would probably only reccommend Dr. Marcus to a friend if I thought the friend was outspoken enough to make sure they got whatever issues they needed to get on the table out before Dr. Marcus left the room. Her exams are, from what I as a layperson can guess, done completely and correctly, but like I said most of the time there's just no easy to decect, heartfelt compassion.

196,Dr. William H. Mollohan,Illinois,license remains on indefinite probation for a minimum of three years and must complete 50 hours Category I Continuing Medical Education annually., Male,3.07,"Its interesting to note that the clinic hours are getting less and less as I could tell that his business is shrinking and its no wonder as he has working for him the rudest and most aggressive staff I have ever come across, right from the unfriendly women that answer the phone to the receptionist and billing staff that constantly make mistakes and will confront you if you dispute a billing question and after you put forward your resonse for there billing mistake will openly say to you "" well its our word against yours so pay up or we will send it to a collection agency "" in my case they failed repeatably to adjust there files to reflect our new family insurer and kept billing old insurer to where there came a cut off point for them to receive payment from the new insurer and then sent me the full bill and said it was my responsibility. Stay away there are lots of other good Doctors out there. dr Mollahan has treated my father, my son and me since 2005. his clinic is open even on saturday- sunday. As a nurse i am an informed consumer. You can't do better than the most experienced physician in the western burbs. He even communicates quite well w/o being condescending. catherine Dr. was given a sanction in December 2010 and fined $1000. Since then he suddenly does not treat patients he has been treating and helping for years. He is the biggest let down and did not put the patient first. Very disapointed, he will be closed soon anyway if you ask me. Gives off a bad vibe. I didn't feel that he was listening. The appointment seemed very rushed. I hate to see doctors who are more interested in money than the well-being of their patients. I will never see him again.","great guy, very helpful. just wish he had better hours, and stuck 2 appts. S.M Dr Mollahan is the reason my son got referred to a substance abusee center. Even when my child threatened to report this great staff and clinic. I am so happy that the know how to handle such young n demanding patients. miss J He is rude and did not hear a word that I said. There was no exam or eye contact. He just said how wonderful he is in taking care of our problems, and he wrote prescriptions for illnesses that I do not have. There are other issues with medication, but I will just leave it like that..... I will never go back there. I had to diagnose myself and tell the doctor what I wanted as an antibiotic for my sinus infection. Neither the doctor nor the nurse examined my ears, nose or throat. On both occasions that I was in the office the doctor was more interested in trying to get me to take Adderall to lose weight than what I was actually there for. The script he gave me for my sinus infection did not heal the infection and he refuses to write another script unless I come back to the office. I will never go back to this doctor. He is more interested in pushing Adderall on his patients than on their actual problems. pleasant, respectful, and he even asked open-ended questions ...roooms seemed a bit small however",4.0,5.0,10,interesting note clinic our getting le le could tell business srinking wonder working rudest aggressive staff ever come across rigt unfriendly woman answer pone receptionist billing staff constantly make mistake confront dispute billing question put forward resonse billing mistake openly say well word pay send collection agency case failed repeatably adjust file reflect new family insurer kept billing old insurer came cut point receive payment new insurer sent full bill said responsibility stay away lot good doctor  mollaan treated fater son since 2005 clinic open even saturday sunday nurse informed consumer cant better experienced pysician western burbs even communicates quite well wo condescending caterine  given sanction december 2010 fined 1000 since suddenly treat patient treating elping year biggest let put patient first disapointed closed soon anyway ask give bad vibe didnt feel listening appointment seemed rused ate see doctor interested money wellbeing patient never see,great guy elpful wis better our stuck 2 appts sm  mollaan reason son got referred substance abusee center even cild treatened report great staff clinic appy know andle young n demanding patient miss j rude ear word said exam eye contact said wonderful taking care problem wrote prescription illness issue medication leave like never go back diagnose tell doctor wanted antibiotic sinus infection neiter doctor nurse examined ear nose troat occasion office doctor interested trying get take adderall lose weigt actually script gave sinus infection eal infection refuse write anoter script unless come back office never go back doctor interested pusing adderall patient actual problem pleasant respectful even asked openended question roooms seemed bit small owever,0.999999,0.999999,0.999839638,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1.0,2.89e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1.27e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999149264,0.714,1,1,1,0,0
197,Dr. William Mikaitis,Illinois,physician and surgeon license and controlled substance licenses revoked due to criminal conviction for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances outside of the usual course of the professional practice and without legitimate medical purpose, Male,4.19,"Prior to an incident in 2005, Dr. Mikaitis was made aware of the potential for harm...but did not listen to a patient's wife. What ensued next on Father's day 2005 was atrocious to say the least. This is what occurs when a Doctor does not know boundaries between patients &friendships. He believed the patient's every word discounting the patients Wife's. Due to this, the wife could have been killed. Alcohol and guns did not mix. Thank GOD the PD took all away due to this incident. This was a blatant case of not being objective...again questioning Patient/Friendship aspects. Patient stayed inpatient for one week & then signed himself out. He was put on a med that REALLY helped but made him feel too much (first coherent conversation had was him being on that med) so he advised he was going to tell the Dr. it was making him sick so the Dr. changed it to Wellbutrin and that was another mistake. There are mental issues here...did the Dr. not think to wonder why the patient was a black out alcoholic all his life? There appeared to be some mistakes made here where the Doctor's friendship with the patient was too close, for what ever reason, leading to clouded judgement. I've never had a more compassionate doctor than dr. M. I've been going to him for over 30 years. My mom n dad went, n my sis, husband, n family still go. One of the old school doctors left.. u better live to 200 years. .. Horrible! My mother had knee surgery with numerous complications. He never checked on her once during the 6 weeks of her hospitalization. He also never returned our phone calls nor responded to family requests to follow up on his patient of 10+ years. Avoid at all costs!","Dr. William Mikaitis has been my family physician for more than 20 years. He is excellent and I will say only this. When my husband was very ill he followed him to the hospital and sat with our family How many Dr s. can we say care abut there patients this way. He always had great advice for my 3 boys all during there teenage years into college years. Dr. Mikaitis has been my doc for over 30 years. He's one of the few left that actually care n listen.

198,Dr. Won Sam Yi,Illinois,physician and surgeon license indefinitely suspended due to an adverse action taken by the State of New York in February 2022., Male,3.38,"Dr Yi treated me for breast cancer. I was severely burned by the radiation but Dr. Yi and his staff keep demanding that I continue the treatment. I was falsely told by Dr. Yi that I would fully heal afterwards, He continually stated healthy tissue would heal but cancerous cells will not. Trust me healthy tissue Does Not fully heal. I have been left with permanent skin damage and fibrosis of my lung. Worse my thyroid gland was destroyed by the radiation and is non functioning. I am allergic to the replacement thyroid medicine. A simple guard to protect my thyroid would of saved me this ongoing trauma. came in late when i had to see him for my 6:50 am appointment. I would have to wait 45 minutes to be seen after my treatment. I would have thought he would have to be there when I was having treatment. Dr. Yi would not accept the fact that I was in severe pain after falling flat on my back 4 weeks after radiation for Bone Mets. He just kept saying that the pain was all in my head. My mind is making it up. What arrogance!","Dr. Yi supervised my whole breast radiation at Spindrift almost five years ago. I have only the highest praise for him and his associates. To this day I am still very grateful for a good outcome both cosmetic and medical. I have gone to Dr. Yi several times for treatments, and although he has been late at times, his knowledge, honesty, and experience makes up for it- I wouldn't judge a physician based on lateness or on a single treatment- the skills matter most and through multiple treatments, I have seen that Dr. Yi cares about his patients, doesn't sugarcoat, and does the best of his ability to treat his patients. I found Dr. Yi and his staff to be most helpful and informative during my recent treatment at CCS Oncology.
